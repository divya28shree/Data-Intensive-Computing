## Lab1:  DATA COLLECTION AND EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

LEARNING OUTCOMES
- Work on data analysis related to socially relevant current topic. (What better than “flu”?)
- Learn by analysis of existing data analysis examples or vignettes. (TwitteR vignette)
- Learn from data analysis and reporting examples available in public sources. (Flu.gov)
- Apply methods for collecting data from publicly available data sources: flu.gov, fluview.
- Install a work environment for carrying out various activities of the data science process: Jupyter, R, RStudio.
- Extract data using APIs and OAuth keys (for collecting tweets).
- Process the data collected for simple data analysis and charting (reproducible research).


### Part 1: 
R basics implementaion for data visualization
### Part 2: 
CDC Flu charts generation. Collect data from CDC site and generate respective charts.
### Part 3: 
Twitter Application generation. Collect data from twitter and plot the charts. Compare it with the actual data in part 2. It provides the overview of the trends on twitter in flu season.


## Lab 2: DATA PIPELINE: AGGREGATION -->MR--> DATA PRODUCT

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
- Automate data collection from multiple sources using the APIs offered by the businesses
- Explain the importance of evaluating the reliability of data (for example: social media vs news media)
- Apply classical big data analytical methods: MapReduce for word count and related family of algorithms such as word occurrence and n-grams
- Work on Hadoop 2.x, and HDFS and process the data using big data algorithms
- Learn a high level language-based data analysis by exploring Python as data processing language
- Apply modern visualization methods and disseminate results using the web/mobile interface

### Part 1: 
Data Collection from *New York Times, Twitter and Common Crawl*.
### Part 2: 
Big Data Implementation *(HADOOP)*: Word Count implementation. Map will clean and parse the data sets into words, remove stop words, stem the words (ex: running to run) and reduce will count the useful words.
### Part 3: 
Analyze and visualize: Visualize eaxch output in *Tableau*.
