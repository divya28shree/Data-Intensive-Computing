December 04, 2014 3:57 PM ESTSenior vp global entertainment, CitiBreithaupt is trying to remember what happened in January. "It feels like five years ago," she says in a nod to the breakneck pace of Citi's tireless and competitive work as a brand partner under her leadership. From hosting private cardmember events during Grammy Week in Los Angeles and Super Bowl Week in New York, to supporting Billy Joel's record-breaking monthly residency at Madison Square Garden, to sponsoring Live Nation and Yahoo's landmark Live 365 concert platform, to setting up a custom cardmember lounge for Katy Perry's Prismatic Tour, Breithaupt's Citi Private Pass program has been building experiences that go way beyond a ticket sale."Jennifer does the best job of any brand marketer whom we work with at building strong industry relationships [with artists, managers and promoters]," says Darin Wolf, Live Nation executive vp media and sponsorships. "She figures out how Citi can add value to the equation. And her ability to make quick, smart decisions helps Citi win more tours than any other company." Breithaupt persuaded Citi to increase its entertainment spend by 16 percent in 2014, with One Direction's tour alone generating a record $40 million in revenue from 458,000 cardmember tickets sold, up from $32 million and 370,000 in 2013. Up next: Continuing Private Pass' expanding involvement with global tours.

December 04, 2014 8:53 PM ESTExecutive vp business affairs/general counsel, Sony Music EntertainmentAll roads at Sony Music Entertainment go through Swidler, whose hands touch every deal made at the music industry's second-largest label group. That's major power -- SME will generate approximately $3 billion in 2014 revenue. In U.S. recorded-music sales, Sony's market share through Nov. 23 was 27.9 percent, a slight decrease from 2013.The majority of the dip comes from the defection of Glassnote earlier this year from Sony's RED distribution service to Universal, but Swidler has seen the positive impact of a deal she helped structure in 2013 to acquire dance label Ultra, home to Calvin Harris, Deadmau5 and Steve Aoki. Harris sold a very healthy 4.1 million tracks this year, according to Nielsen SoundScan, but just as important was bringing Ultra founder Patrick Moxey into the label's system by making him the president of electronic music at Sony."That was not a throwaway title for him," says Swidler. "He took it very seriously, and has weekly calls with our people worldwide where they talk about EDM and what's going on in music and who are the best A&R people out there."Swidler, who is married with three children and lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side, began her career in the legal department of the ad agency J. Walter Thompson, involved with the in-house publishing company for jingles. She has an office at 550 Madison Ave. next door to Epic chairman/CEO Antonio "L.A." Reid, known for playing his music loud. "I love hearing every mix of every new song he is working on," she says. But Swidler spent much of 2014 outside the office, traveling to London, Nashville and Los Angeles to meet with managers and artist reps. One consistent concern from the artist side: the payout of streaming services in the United States."I point out to them that those services are bigger in places like Scandinavia and France, where you have artists earning a fair amount of money in the streaming business," says Swidler. "I don't want people to feel that we are at the top of the mountain and won't answer questions. If people aren't getting answers, then I joke to them that they didn't ask me."

December 04, 2014 9:19 PM ESTIncoming Chairman/CEO, Universal Music Publishing GroupGerson is about to cata­pult from being one of the most powerful executives in the A&R sector to one of the most powerful executives in the overall music industry. In January, she will assume command of Universal Music Publishing Group: She is leaving Sony/ATV, where she was co-president and in charge of the company's West Coast office. Sony/ATV is the No. 1 music publisher, overseeing an estimated $1.2 billion in annual revenue, including EMI Music Publishing, for which it serves as administrator. Its chairman/CEO, Martin Bandier, has credited Gerson with building a writer-centric ethos there. She is well-known for spotting talent early. At Sony/ATV, she signed Lady Gaga, Norah Jones and Alicia Keys, who was just 15 when Gerson had the foresight to ink a deal.Gerson will tap that remarkable radar to spark a "cultural shift" at UMPG. She talks about marrying the company's business capabilities with A&R so that the creative nature is at the top. "Without having great talent and nurturing it, we are nothing," she says. "The challenge is to step out and be very involved in advocating for songwriters to make sure we add real value to their careers."UMPG's annual revenue is about $900 million. "We want to be the No. 1 music publisher," she says. "That doesn't mean market share. It means offering services to our songwriters and thinking outside the box to get the most value for their songs."Gerson, a single mother of three, knew she wanted to be in the music business from a young age. Her father owned a nightclub, the Latin Casino, in Cherry Hill, N.J., outside Philadelphia, where everyone from Frank Sinatra to Teddy Pendergrass played. "I grew up with a certain comfort level for the talent," she says. Her career began at Chappell Music, as an archivist in the company's sheet-music library. "I have always wanted to be in publishing, even though labels have called me now and then in the past.""Without having great talent and nurturing it, we are nothing," says Gerson.

Hailing from the South Florida "SoundCloud rap" scene along with contemporaries like Smokepurpp, XXXTentacion and Ski Mask the Slump God, the ­pink-haired teenager born Gazzy Garcia had already amassed over 100,000 followers on Instagram, despite ­having released only a ­handful of songs at the time."He was the youngest in the wave actually really doing it," says Battle, "and his look was different than everybody else."Battle, himself a South Florida native, knew what to do: tap his ­company’s 60 social media ­"influencers" to spread the music. Tha Lights Global was in the midst of a social-media-driven meme ­campaign that helped Zay Hilfigerrr & Zayion McCall's "Juju on That Beat" reach No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in December 2016. The company is helmed by a tight-knit seven-person team whose members’ average age is in the mid-20s: Battle; co-founder Tim Lowery; head of touring and marketing Troy Heidtmann; A&R chief Miguel Solano; head of management and media Jordan Tugrul; head of talent relations Carliely Veras and head of digital Paula Batson. But the label, ­management and marketing group’s secret sauce is its network of influencers that reaches a combined 160 million ­followers across nine different platforms. Pushing Lil Pump’s songs through SoundCloud and Instagram, these influencers boosted the rapper’s followers on the latter platform from 1 million in June to 5.7 million in November. Earlier in 2017, Tha Lights Global signed a joint venture deal with Warner Bros. Records, which began marketing Lil Pump’s music during the summer.
"We, as a company and as a label, needed to build and establish more of a presence in the urban space," says WBR executive vp commerce and marketing Larry Mattera. "They clearly had insights and relationships on the urban side of the business in the network landscape, where we’re always trying to look for influencers and how to utilize social networks in a meaningful way.""They’re innovative spirits, and they don’t take no for an answer," says Warner Bros. chairman/CEO Cameron Strang. "Pump is an incredible artist; he’s got fantastic charisma and a huge personality, with lots of talent and no fear."Warner Bros. and Tha Lights Global limited Lil Pump’s access to the media in order to push fans to the music to learn more about him; in a recent 2,770-word Complex cover story, Pump’s quotes totaled fewer than 20 words. But his fans have shown a tendency to latch on to the words he does say and take action: The now-17-year-old artist only follows @Harvard on Instagram, and after the rapper tweeted in August that he "really did drop out of Harvard to save the rap game," his ­followers flooded the school’s Instagram page, which, says Battle, caused Harvard to temporarily ­disable comments. (A rep for Harvard did not respond to a request for comment.) "He's growing [his career] organically, he's not forcing it or telling people to go do [things]," Battle says. "He's just putting it out, they get the notification and they go do it."
The groundwork paid off: In October, Lil Pump’s self-titled debut album launched at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, moving 46,000 equivalent album units in its first week, according to Nielsen Music -- 83 percent of which came from streaming. On the Dec. 9 Hot 100, his lead single, "Gucci Gang," spends its second week at No. 3, with 49.8 million streams -- up 11 percent in its 11th week on the chart. And Pump's success isn't the only example of unorthodox, social media campaigns; now, influencers have become an ­essential part of the marketing plan for breaking new artists."As influencers are growing by the thousands because of technology, I think we would be late if we didn't feel that influencer marketing wasn't something we needed to staff and strategize," says 300 Entertainment CEO Kevin Liles, who used influencer-driven campaigns on Musically and YouTube to boost artists Maggie Lindemann and Dae Dae, respectively. "Anybody who can help us reach that target audience, we want to build infrastructure around."YouTube star and author Connor Franta, who built a following of 8.8 million on Twitter and more than 5 million on YouTube, founded the record label Heard Well in 2015, tapping fellow influencers like Tyler Oakley and U.S. Olympian Gabby Douglas to curate compilations that the label licenses and releases digitally. In July, Heard Well signed a deal with Sony/ATV that came with an infusion of funding, with an eye towards turning their compilation business into a full-service record label and sign its first artist within the next year. "We're partnering with people who are marketing geniuses on their own," Franta says, noting the company spends no money on advertising their releases. "We're working with influencers with big followings: they are the ads."
With Pump, Tha Lights Global and Warner Bros. are now leveraging relationships with streaming services and distributors around the world to spread the music globally. But as "Gucci Gang" keeps growing, the label is riding the wave. "I think he's found and touched a nerve in that culture, given his music, given his interaction with his fans," Mattera says. "It's hard to pinpoint it. But these moments where you find something like that, you just let it lead the way and don't ask a lot of questions and just try to keep it moving."This article originally appeared in the Dec. 9 issue of Billboard.

Growing up in Chesapeake, Va., she would sit on the front porch of her grandfather’s house and sing country music with her family. “I found a tape a few months back, and I was correcting my grandfather on his diction on ‘You Are My Sunshine.’ That was probably foreshadowing,” says Lacy with a laugh. She was 4 years old at the time.Flash forward 41 years and Lacy is still telling singers what to do. But now it’s as senior vp A&R at Warner Music Nashville, a role to which she was ­promoted last September after over a decade at WMN. Currently she works with artists like Ashley McBryde, Blake Shelton, Devin Dawson, Chris Janson, Dan + Shay and Warner Bros.’ latest signing, Kenny Chesney. The lattermost artist is a dream come true for Lacy, who has known Chesney since she was a young ­receptionist at Tom Collins Publishing and he was a developing writer-artist signed to Tree Publishing.More than two decades into his career, much of it spent at Sony Music Nashville, Chesney signed with Warner in January, due in part to his relationship with Lacy. His first Warner Bros. Records single, “Get Along,” is No. 7 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs and No. 57 on the Hot 100 dated June 9, while his new album, Songs for the Saints, is due July 27.
Lacy, who sources say is being groomed to succeed current president/CEO John “Espo” Esposito, is held in high regard at the label. “When I joined the Warner Nashville family in 2009, I told [executive vp A&R] Scott Hendricks and Cris Lacy that A&R would lead the company,” says Esposito. “In those nearly nine years, I have been nothing but amazed and inspired by Cris’ unique musical sensibilities,” he says, calling her “as artist-sensitive as anyone I have ever met.”Sitting on the floor and sipping water in the Warner Bros. offices on Nashville’s Music Row, Lacy spoke to Billboard about Chesney, country’s current competitive A&R landscape and the lack of diversity both in A&R and country-radio airplay for women executives and artists.Billboard: You spent many years as a publisher. How did that help you when you switched to label A&R?Cris Lacy: I learned how to articulate constructive criticism with songs. It's really difficult if you're speaking with a writer to tell them something doesn't feel right, but not be able to tell them what it is. The writers that I had the privilege to work with taught me the craft of songwriting, through the way that they wrote, but also through conversations. So that's something that I use every day when I listen to songs. [WB] is about 50-50 in terms of writer/artists who write their own material. If we don't have [songs], we die. I listen to hundreds of songs a week and it's not lost on me that it's really, really hard to write a great song.
Over the years, even after you arrived at Warner in 2005, you would send Kenny Chesney songs. Did he ever cut anything you sent?He cut "I Melt,” which ended up being a No. 1 record for Rascal Flatts, before they cut it. As a publisher, I would call him with one song maybe every six months to a year and he would say, "I'm over at Carissa’s Antiques, come over and meet me and play it for me in my truck.”Any truth to the rumor that you had a shrine to Kenny in your office?In the corner of my desk, when I thought there was a possibility someday that he might want to work with someone else [besides Sony]. I'm sure people walked into the office and thought, "Why does she have a picture of Kenny Chesney in the corner of her desk?" One, I wanted that to happen so badly. And two, I always thought, if I take a song and give it to one of my newer artists, is this gonna give that artist the platform that Kenny Chesney has? And I would use that as a litmus test. I finally gave up and took the shrine down. I thought, "It's not gonna happen. I need to stop with this pipe dream." Then two months later, he showed back up [and was available].
You signed one of this year’s most critically-acclaimed acts, Ashley McBryde. What did you see in her?I just saw the truth. I'd seen her about a year and a half before [at] a showcase. She sang her ass off, she was funny, she was self-deprecating. She was so entertaining, but it just felt like there was more to her than these songs that looked like maybe they were crafted to be on country radio. And I remember thinking, "Her personality is so great and she's so truthful, I wish the music felt like that." Then she came back with new music. I [listened to] "Girl Going Nowhere” on my front porch and I just broke down. I called Espo and said, "Okay, we have to do this.”
It’s a very competitive time on Music Row right now for signing acts. Why is that?Partially, it's that country is no longer as much of a niche [genre]. It's the catch-all. It's folks that have a folk background, people that used to be in the rock world, singer-songwriters and traditional core-country radio. It's also competitive because the internet is making it really easy to see what songs are talking back, what artists are selling tickets and resonating, and what their consumption looks like. The artists that are coming to town are so much more developed. I don't know if it's because they've had recording equipment their whole lives and they can video themselves and they can learn things that we couldn't learn because we were recording onto a cassette. I don't think I've seen a bad artist in years. Finding a needle in a haystack, like going to a show and seeing something nobody else has seen, is really rare.Who is someone you passed on signing that you regret?LANCO. We really liked them, we just thought it wasn't ready yet. We met Brett Young when he just came to town and thought he was good, but thought there was still some time for him to develop. Well, he developed really quickly. He started writing great songs really quickly, and I wasn't there for that. But somebody else was and they signed him.With Devin Dawson, you released several tracks and remixes ahead of the album and before sending a single to radio. Is that something you’re moving more toward?We wanted to build a story for radio. We’re using [streaming and satellite] platforms to get people interested. Now they’ve heard five songs that make them want to buy a ticket. And we’re funding that tour. We're doing that with all of our artists now. [New Warner Music Group CEO] Max Lousada has this “more is more” [theory] -- Give the fans more things that they want. You have to keep re-engaging them. Terrestrial radio can be working one song, SiriusXM can be playing two, Spotify can be playing a totally different one, so you're getting all of these impressions that really give consumers a great rounded picture of who this artist is.
Why are there so few female A&R executives?I don't know. I think women are very empathetic and very nurturing, and those are things that you need in an A&R person. I don't know if that's a gender thing, but it took me a long time to trust myself to sit in that room and look at someone who had 72 No. 1 records and say, "My opinion is as valuable as yours.” I don't know if as women, it takes us longer to be confident in our opinions. I needed to have the confidence to step forward.
Country radio is still reluctant to play female artists. Does that affect who you sign?Not at all. I want to sign great female artists whether they fit on radio or don't fit on radio. If you sign a female artist like Kacey Musgraves, she’s doing great, but there's not an unrealistic expectation that every song she puts out is going to go No. 1 at radio. As long as the artist has the same expectation that you have that you're working together to build a career. But the music has to be great.What happens when the music isn’t great?It's heartbreaking for me. It takes so long to get music recorded and artists put every piece of themselves into it. It makes my stomach hurt and I lose sleep over it. [After discussing], if the artist [still] says, “This is me. I'm willing to live or die by this music,” then I respect that. They are the ones that have to live with it and sing it every night. So at that point, we go after it. Let's put a couple things out at streaming or let's see if [Sirius]XM will play a few things. Let's work on some alternative marketing things. It's their dream and that's what we're here to support.This article originally appeared in the June 2 issue of Billboard.

Below is the full text of Grainge’s acceptance speech:Thank you, Abel. Not only for your generous introduction, but also for the extraordinary music you bring to the world.Ariana, thank you as well. You’re one of the greatest vocalists alive, and your songwriting grows more powerful every year.To Linda [Moran] and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, I’m so moved by this honor -- Howie Richmond was a giant in our industry and also happens to be the publisher of one of my favorite songs of all time, “A Boy Named Sue.” Receiving this Hitmaker award is a real tribute to the path he and others blazed. I also want to recognize the incredible Universal Music writers and recording artists that are being honored here tonight including: Bill Anderson, Steve Dorff, Alan Jackson, Kool & The Gang, John Mellencamp, Allee Willis and of course my dear friend Neil Diamond.Because nobody gets here on their own. I owe so much to my wife Caroline, who brings harmony to my life, and to my entire team at Universal -- whose passion and talent make my work possible. Jody Gerson, especially, really knows how to a build a culture that puts songwriters first, and that always comes through in the music. [Gerson is chairman/CEO, Universal Music Publishing Group.]So to all of you, words cannot express my gratitude.I trace my love for music to North London, where I grew up in the ‘60s and ‘70s. My father owned a small record shop, and so our family listened to just about everything -- from Wagner to Ray Charles to Mozart to Elvis.Dad was also an incredible whistler. I can still see him now -- face covered in shaving cream, transistor radio next to the bathroom sink, whistling along with the coda from “Hey Jude,” which had just been released.To this day, when people ask me what my favorite songs are, I say it’s anything I can whistle.Despite the fact that I was a nice Jewish boy, my parents sent me to a nice Christian school, because it offered the best education in our neighborhood. Surprisingly, my favorite part of the school day, beginning when I was five or six, were the mandatory morning hymns. That’s where discovered my love of melody. My passion for music was born.When I was 12, my brother Nigel was already 25, and working at Phonogram as a marketer. His company car was a huge GM station wagon full of records, tape, sharpies, staple guns and posters. Every weekend, after lunch with our grandparents, I would swipe his keys, clamber into the back, and “borrow” as many records as I could.
Looking back, the introduction that Nigel and my dad provided was the foundation of my entire career. I passed on college and joined April Blackwood in 1979, then stayed in the music publishing business until 1993. In fact, I spent the first third of my career in music publishing. And professionally, those were the years that really shaped me.To go back and forth with a songwriter, exchanging ideas with nothing more than a guitar or piano, is a beautiful and intimate creative experience. It’s so much purer than playing a recording back in the studio, because there’s no hiding behind production, EQ and instrumentation. Now that is the litmus test of a great song.For those who think that much of the music produced today lacks melody or composition -- I’d encourage you to keep listening. Trust me, a few decades from now, the best songwriting will still hold its own, just as the Sex Pistols, Run-DMC, The Clash or Public Enemy do today, a generation after the establishment dismissed them as unlistenable.My point is that being an encyclopedia of music -- which those of us in the business tend to be -- can sometimes be a hindrance. Instead, we always need to keep our minds wide open and keep listening to new ideas through young ears.When we do, and if we’re lucky, we just might hear a song that inspires us to whistle.Thank you again for this honor.

While the Running Man had the whole world moving and shaking, the Mannequin Challenge mainly consists of freezing in an odd or dramatic action.
Destiny's Child hopped on the newest trend with Lauryn Hill's "Every Ghetto, Every City" lingering in the background. Beyonce and Michelle Williams are seen frozen in positions that suggest the two were playing a game of catch, while Kelly Rowland grips a balloon with a mean-mug plastered on her face. Check out Destiny's Child's Mannequin Challenge below.

Gucci Mane, who recently announced the December release date for his upcoming album Evil Genius, features with a verse in which he hypes up Wang while addressing those who aren’t yet on his level. “Balling like Lamar/Jackson a dual threat,” he says. “You just a freshman you still ain’t in the league yet.”One-seventh of the K-pop boy band GOT7, Hong Kong-born Wang simultaneously pursues a career in the Chinese market along with his activities in the South Korean music scene. "Different Game" is his latest single as a soloist in 2018, following the release of other songs including "Dawn of Us," "Bruce Lee" with Al Rocco," and "Fendiman." Along with his work as a member of GOT7, he's also been busy on several other collaborations this year in China. He regularly appears on the China V chart, and his song "Fendiman" debuted in the top 10 of the Rap Digital Song Sales chart earlier this year, peaking at No. 8 on the chart dated June 9.
"Different Game" is available through digital music platforms, including Spotify, Tidal, and Apple Music. Watch the music video for “Different Game” below.

His first album is scheduled for release in June. "Interscope understood what I wanted to do creatively and it wasn't just about money. I got everything I wanted."
Banos and his manager, Doris Muñoz, 25, stood their ground until the deal that made the most sense surfaced. Enter Interscope: known for its roster of iconic acts such Dr. Dre, Lady Gaga and U2 in addition to a new generation of celebrated voices in their 20s including British R&B singer Ella Mai, American rapper Juice WRLD and the genre hopping Colombian American songstress Kali Uchis."Cuco is a genius," says Carlos Cancela, the Interscope A&R executive who first saw Banos perform at The High Hat in L.A. two years ago. "A week later Doris and Cuco came to my office and we talked about life, music and we played records back and fourth."From the outside, Cancela played it cool during his two-year pursuit of Banos. But on the inside he was anxious. He wanted to work with Banos and support his developing style of music, which has connected with a Latinx U.S. audience and beyond.Banos' eclectic style meshes a variety of genres including hip-hop, synth-pop, trap, psychedelic and oldies that have a classic throwback vibe similar to a 1950's Ritchie Valens song, but updated for a new generation of fans. His quirky, often humorous and romantic songs, such as  “Lo Que Siento” (What I feel), "Lover is Day" and  "CR-V," an homage to his Honda SUV, have translated to more than 30 million YouTube views. The Hawthorne, Calif.-born artist recently collaborated on the electro-pop track "Fix Me" with Dillon Francis."Cuco is not trying to fit in," said Cancela, 28, a Cuban American from Miami, who now lives in L.A. "He's doing his own thing, finding his own way."Banos was eight when he began playing music. The guitar came first before he added the bass, followed by keys, drums, trumpet, the French horn and the mellophone. In 2016, he released his first mixtape, Wannabewithu, with songs that highlighted breakups with his unique sound that included lo-fi synths, trumpets and his guitar. It was part of his Spanglish style that has attracted young Latinos to his backyard parties in the Los Angeles.Cancela confirmed Banos' first album is slated for the summer, while Muñoz reflected on the record deal's structure, which has a "no true album commitment," she says. It's part of a joint venture license deal with the goal of releasing an album during each contract period with an alternative delivery commitment so that music can be released in "various configurations" as long as Banos releases a certain number of songs."Omar owns all of his masters," says Muñoz of the Interscope deal, adding that the contract as a joint venture license is a healthy seven-figure deal, which includes owning his own music 100 percent. "We didn't want to do a typical record deal. It's been that way and that's the way it will always be. Ownership was the important factor in moving forward with the deal. That makes me so proud that we were able to make something like that happen. Omar didn't have to feel like he was signing his life away with this deal. It feels beautiful."As part of the Interscope agreement, Banos will also have his music released in Latin America as a Latinx artist with the support of Universal Music Latin Entertainment, Muñoz said, ensuring that international territories push his music. Brokering the deal on Banos' side was Muñoz and Banos' attorney Carron Mitchell. Those involved on the label side include Interscope Geffen A&M chairman/CEO John Janick, head of A&R Sam Riback and Cancela, "who sealed the deal," Muñoz said. One of the hardest things about signing with Interscope, Muñoz said, was letting the other three contenders know. "Everybody involved in these negotiations had so much love for Omar and he felt seen, heard and valued," Muñoz says. "They went above and beyond to try to seal the deal with Omar, but at the end of the day he went with what he wanted. They took it well; no one was mean about it or mad. We still have super great relationships with them."
When it comes to touring, Banos has been represented by the Paradigm Talent Agency since the spring of 2017 and that also built momentum as he went from backyard shows to major festival circuit in 2018. In 2018, Banos performed at the Coachella Music and Arts Festival and that further pushed his rise in music. Before that he booked the smaller Viva! Pomona music festival in Southern California, which paved the way to Coachella."If it wasn't for Paradigm's hard work we would not be here at all," Muñoz said.What's next for Banos? "Cuco is still is self-published, so that's the next one," Muñoz says, who was previously a tour manager and intern at Columbia Records in the A&R division. "We are very clear about ownership." Banos echoes those sentiments, but he values relationships first. "The people I work with are like my friends and that's really cool to have," says Banos. "It's a very professional environment, but at the same time it's super chill and we can just hang out."

Bush. The song questions the former president about his feelings toward homelessness, LGBTQ rights and the Iraq War, among other issues.Though it seems P!nk has no intention of penning a song to President Trump, this isn’t the first time she’s challenged him. Last week, the outspoken pop-rocker marched alongside her family at the Women’s March in Los Angeles. She also had some words for her less-than-tolerant fans the day after Trump’s election, captioning an Instagram with the following:“To anyone reading this: if you think this is a time for misogynistic jokes, or for laughing about voting in a person that doesn't believe in climate change, or humanity. To any of you closet racists, homophobes, sexists..... please block me. Please unfollow me. We do not respect each other. You do not have my respect, and I obviously don't have yours. We are not friends. To everyone else, we shall overcome. Stay on the path of love and tolerance. Hug your kids. Teach them about diversity and about fighting for others, and sticking up for themselves. I will do my part.”

This fear of the unknown crept into the music of our favorite late-'90s pop stars, from the baby robot voice embedded throughout Britney Spears’ ...Baby One More Time debut, Backstreet Boys shooting their second album Millennium right into outer space and Blaque booming like an earth-shattering 808 on its self-titled debut. But it was TLC who fully embraced the impending chaos that many thought the Y2K Scare was going to bring, with their third album FanMail.The album, which turns 20 on Saturday (Feb. 23), aestheticized a digital world that was born after the turbulent events that the girl group went through during the five-year hiatus they took after releasing 1994’s Diamond-certified CrazySexyCool, still the best-selling U.S. album by a girl group of all time. Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas became a first-time mother with the group’s longtime producer Dallas Austin, Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins spent many nights in the hospital to combat her sickle-cell anemia, and the late Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes made headlines for burning down the house of ex-boyfriend Andre Rison, while also getting into conflict with other members about TLC's musical direction.Throughout all of this, the group revealed they were bankrupt, and trying to claw themselves out of a messy contract with Pebbitone, the management company founded by L.A. Reid's former wife Pebbles. When they finally got back into the studio, they decided to dedicate the entire album to their supportive fans -- but the recording process wasn’t easy.
“The only thing we were nervous about was being gone for so long and wanting everyone to [still] accept you,” T-Boz tells Billboard. “But FanMail was the one where Lisa started tripping out! [Laughs.] That's when she decided after we signed our contractual obligation that she wanted to go solo. All of that drama!” Due to Left Eye’s absence, the group had to figure out how to replace her signature voice. Thus, the female android Vic-E was created. “Lisa didn’t want to be in the studio at the time so Dallas and I were just like, ‘Well, "eff" it! We’ll make the computer rap!’” T-Boz continues. “We went on the Mac computer, and back then you could choose different voices [as your greeting]. So we picked Vic-E because she sounded sexy. When Lisa got back on board, she said, "Well shit, let's go ahead and make it a character!" Austin, who was friends with Chilli and T-Boz before the group’s ideation, echoed: “[Recording] was a little bit of a disaster because Left Eye wanted to take it a little too far and name the album Fan2See. She wanted a website where the fans would be able to create their own fantasies. Back then we had Lil Kim and other female rappers doing their thing, so she wanted to push the envelope a bit more. When we told her it wasn't a good idea, she got a little mad at us.”The narration of FanMail’s Vic-E was a direct reflection of the era’s journey to cyberspace, as seen with the rise of of AOL Instant Messenger, HotMail and dial-up connections. With Left Eye now just a sporadic presence, the album filled that void with dial tones, glitchy synths, computer keyboard clicks and warped vocal effects that echoed the cold nature of the song’s themes. “I was dying to get into the future because 2000 was about to come up,” explains Austin. "But I've always been into that stuff because I'm a big Star Wars fan. Since we had to use Vic-E in place of Lisa's voice, I thought, 'Let's just go as futuristic as we can.'" Those otherworldly elements were found not just in the songs themselves, but the actual binary code-wrapped album cover as well. “We were actually painted with real silver paint,” reveals Chilli. “When we had the shoot, [photographer] Dah Len of course saved that for the end because you just can't throw that on and wipe it off for another look. I showered so much for a whole week! It was behind the ears, on our neck, under our chin, around our nose -- just everywhere. That was not digitally altered at all. We went in for real.”All of these creative risks proved successful for TLC, as FanMail peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and stayed there for five non-consecutive weeks. It was certified six times Platinum by the RIAA and spawned two massive No. 1 hits: “No Scrubs” (which topped the Hot 100 for four straight weeks) and “Unpretty” (three weeks at No. 1). The album was also nominated for eight Grammys, including album of the year, and took home the trophies for best R&B album, best R&B performance by a duo or group with vocals and best R&B song for “No Scrubs.”
Below, TLC’s T-Boz and Chilli -- along with collaborator Kandi Burruss and the album's co-executive producer Dallas Austin -- dive into the backstory of every track of FanMail (not including the three interludes), and reflect on what the impact of its mainstream success meant for the future of R&B.“FanMail”Dallas Austin: I thought the FanMail concept was brilliant. So I took a bunch of interviews they did to create the actual "FanMail" song. I was listening to a lot of drum and bass, which was becoming big in London at the time. I thought, "How do I incorporate this without being too overbearing for people?" I always looked at albums like movies, so I seek out the title track. When you hear "FanMail," that should help you understand what the rest of the album is gonna feel like. It's become one of my favorite songs I've done.Chilli: We used to get so much fan mail back then, and we just could not respond to everybody. A lot of it got lost, and then we tried to retrieve as much as we could. So that was the song for the fans period. It was us feeling bad that we weren't able to get to everybody. When Drake redid "FanMail” [with 2010’s “I Get Lonely Too”], that was a big deal. It's funny because a lot of our fans told us about his cover. But I wasn't very familiar with Drake. When I heard it, I wanted to make sure he did a good job -- I didn't care who it was! [laughs] And I thought he did great. I was really happy with how he put his own little spin on it.T-Boz: [The title] was actually Lisa's idea. When we were going through all that [legal] stuff with Pebbles [Reid] and trying to get away from her, we had missed a lot of fanmail. We tried to fit as many names as we can possibly fit in the [album booklet]. When the record company screws you over and doesn't promote certain things the way they should have been, the fans make you realize you're still important. Because we didn't even promote this [album] and it still went platinum. “Silly Ho”Austin: I knew they had a great response from fans in Japan from the last record. So I wanted to include that international aspect in the album. Everyone thinks about Europe when they're making a record, but not Japan. So I started the song out with [mimics sound effects], ding-ding-ding-ding! And the ["Vic-E Interpretation"] interlude before it says, "In Japan they just move to the one and two." So that, along with the street lyrics, separated the group at that time. T-Boz loved "Silly Ho" because she liked songs that didn't make her feel like too soft of a girl.T-Boz: Well "ho" is my favorite word 'cause I don't like them! [Laughs.] We used to put up signs in the studio that said "No hoes allowed." Dallas said that we should write a song about it, so I just talked about everything that I didn't like about hoes. It’s so funny because that’s the song my kids like the most, and of course it had to be the most explicit one. I can’t clean it up, there’s no way to get around hoes!Chilli: When the song got leaked, I heard that Timbaland got upset about it. He was feeling like Dallas bit off of his sound or whatever. I didn't think it sounded exactly like his stuff, but it definitely sounded like maybe he could have did a collaboration. It was just a popular sound at the time. The lyrics are so TLC, as far as our whole girl power thing and talking about guys. It's actually one of my favorite songs to perform.“No Scrubs”Kandi Burruss: [Xscape girl group member Tameka "Tiny" Cottle] and I got the music from [producer Kevin "She'kspere" Briggs]. I had this notepad that I used to write song titles or concepts in. I used to say it to all my friends all the time: If there was like a dude that was wack, we just called him "that scrub." So I thought, "That'd be a cute concept for our record." One day I was riding around with my friend while listening to the track that She'kspere gave me. We were both were dating brothers at the time, and we were dogging them out because we were mad at them. I freestyled the entire song while just driving down a highway: the verse, hook, pre-chorus, the whole thing. I actually wrote a majority of the record on an old envelope that was sitting in my car! I took it to Tiny the next day. The lyric originally was: [sings] "A scrub is a guy who thinks he's fly and also known as a busta/ Always talking about what he wants and just sits on his fat ass!" Tiny busted out laughing and was like, "Girl, you are so crazy!" But I thought that people were going to like it.Austin: So this song came in at the last minute. It was originally for Kandi and Tiny because they wanted to do a project together. But I told Kevin, "If you let me have this for TLC, I'll make it the first single." It would be different, with Chili singing the record, rather than us always starting with T-Boz. "No Scrubs" was a breakthrough for Chili because we hadn't focused on her like that for the first two albums. It was a great way to expose her; being a secondary vocalist was not just her purpose. After the song's success, it felt like TLC was a new group, because we took a different approach to reinvent them.T-Boz: Kandi and Tiny wrote the heck out of that song, and I'm glad they gave it to us instead of keeping it for themselves. When we did the video, we went all out except for Chili -- she wanted to look like an island princess! [Laughs.] I was so excited about the part where I wore the all-white outfit where my boobs lit up. We never really did anything super sexy like that. I remember not having a routine and [the video’s director Hype Williams] just told me to dance. RuPaul also came to see us on set, but he wasn't in drag. His makeup artist [Mathu Andersen] did our makeup and it was so amazing. Me and Lisa had a ball with that. I was like, "Can I put rhinestones on my lips too?" Chilli: Being on set was really scary, especially the one scene where it was all three of us and it looked like we were in space. This tube thing was constantly moving so you couldn't stand still or else you would fall. I was getting so frustrated and yelling, "How many more takes?" Lisa was falling and we were hitting each other by accident, it was just crazy. That's why we were acting so silly at the end of the video, because trying to fight against [the moving set] was not working. Then, there was that really ginormous swing. I had to practice first because I was so nervous. Of course by the end, I didn't want to get off the thing! That was a long day, but it was fun doing the whole futuristic stuff. Even our space suit-looking outfits were right up our alley. We always knew that our image was just as important as our music.
“No Scrubs” is an empowerment anthem. When we are performing it, I look out in the audience and say this cool little speech about certain guys you got to stay away from. I always say this -- and I'll say it forever -- but scrubs are like roaches. You can never get them under control completely. [Laughs.] They just won't die. They just keep multiplying. That's why you just got to stay away from them suckers! The reason I knew [the song] was going to be big because what it's talking about is so relatable to every woman in America. It doesn't matter where you are in the world, scrubs come in all shapes, sizes and colors. So it was just a universal song that every woman can high-five each other with. It was a winner.We were cracking up when we heard Sporty Thieves' [response track] "No Pigeons." There's so many songs that are negative towards women and you don't hear a lot of females saying, "We’ve got to do an anti version of that one." So it's funny that you have these guys that want to flip "No Scrubs" real quick. They can't take the heat! I just knew that our song hit some real nerves. But I absolutely loved Weezer's version, and reposted it on Instagram. We're actually talking with them now and trying to figure out when we're going to perform it together on upcoming shows. I love when guys sing that song. Any man that can sing "No Scrubs" comfortably, he is definitely not a scrub --- or he's a reformed scrub. Those days are far behind him and he’s like, “I can sing this proudly!” [Laughs.]
“I’m Good At Being Bad”Chilli: We actually worked with Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis on this one. They are the sweetest people ever. You would be so surprised at how humble they are, no diva [attitude] anywhere. They were so creative and open to our ideas. They asked for our input, so the collaboration was amazing. Tionne and Lisa were really excited about saying "I need a crump, tight n---a" and all that kind of stuff. I was just like, "Guys I'm not saying all that! I got the pretty stuff." The song is jamming, I just don't like saying the n-word.T-Boz: So I wrote the song with Jimmy Jam in Minneapolis, and he works so fast. He said, Jjust go to the booth. I'm gonna play the beat. Whatever comes to your mind, just hum it." I had never written like that before. Usually you listened to the beat, you sit down and you write it. But that technique really helped me grown as a writer. So I got out the booth then we wrote the lyrics to it.I loved the way Kurt Cobain used to go soft and then hard, like on "Smells Like Teen Spirit." So I told Jimmy we could be like Nirvana, just sing really pretty and then go into "I need a crump type n---a!" I actually wanted Lisa to do that first rap part, but she thought I sounded good because my voice was thicker. So they keep me on it until she did the final rap verse.Austin: Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis are my favorite producers in the world. They just did Michael and Janet Jackson's "Scream" [in 1995] and I was like, "Wow, these guys are insane!" So when we got them for the TLC project, I knew they were gonna come with something different. When I first heard "I'm Good At Being Bad" I thought, "NO. WAY. This is crazy!" They did a great job of showing off the [R&B] genre, and it was a great contrast for all three of them.“If They Knew”Chilli: This song is just giving another perspective [of a relationship], because we're definitely not about being on that side whatsoever. But we always thought that it was important to make songs that were not always just from our point of views, but from some of our friends who were experiencing things like that. T-Boz: Me, Dallas and Lisa were in the studio basically gossiping about scenarios we know about, with guys trying to get with you when he's in a relationship. And that happens all the time. That's how people cheat. We've all been approached by somebody who's married or already in a relationship and you know, we're basically talking about how [would] that other girl feel, if she knew you were doing this over here with me?“I Miss You So Much”T-Boz: Chilli ended up doing this as a solo song because it's just too pretty for me. I was too rough and rugged for that at the time, I don't want to talk about missing nobody! [Laughs.] But she sounded amazing and it was totally up her alley. It really highlighted her as a singer. I would have messed the song up!Chilli: We were signed to [FanMail co-executive producer] Babyface’s label [LaFace Records], so I was always around him. He is such a joy to work with. A lot of people do not know that he is actually a really silly guy. He's just very quiet and observes everything. But when we would get in the studio, we just laughed the whole time.We were at the end of recording the album and I was sick. I had like a sinus infection and was on all these steroids trying to get my voice back all the way. And I asked Babyface, "Can we do [this song] next weekend?" But we had this deadline to finish the album. And so I was just like nasal spraying it up. It was crazy. I wanted to redo it because I sounded stuffy. But he thought it sounded good and was going to work out well. I just loved being in the studio with him because he helps to bring out things in you that you didn't even know you had. “Unpretty”T-Boz: At the time, I had just got out the hospital and was in my hotel room. My boyfriend still went out and left me. When you get out the hospital, you feel so weak and frail and ugly. I had all these IV marks and bruises everywhere, and I was just really skinny. When he left, I was watching [an episode of] Ricki Lake that night, where these men were calling women fat pigs, so I was already emotional. I went to the desk, turned on the light and I got a piece of paper. Men have a way of making us feel the opposite of pretty. So I put "un-" in front of it. That actually sparked me writing a whole poetry book on my thoughts. So I took this poem to Dallas and he was like, "Oh my god, this is it!" He got in the booth so fast and put it in song form.The words mean everything when I sing them, because that's every last emotion that I felt. But I had no idea that so many other people felt the way that I did, until the song went to No. 1 [on the Billboard Hot 100]. I remember Lady Gaga was crying so hard when she met me [in 2013]. She said, "You don't understand how much 'Unpretty’ changed my life, because I was an outcast." Fans also told me the song prevented them from committing suicide. That was deep, and I’m glad our song could help people.
Austin: I knew I wanted to do a song like "Unpretty," because at the time I was listening to a lot of folk and alternative artists like Ani DiFranco and Tori Amos. I was trying to figure out a way to bridge that into TLC's music, because I knew that would make them different [compared to] everybody else. By having an acoustic-driven pop song, that would take them to a whole 'nother place they haven't been before. So "Unpretty" was a big breakout record for them, just as much as "Waterfalls" was. It separated them from Destiny's Child and SWV. I didn't want people to see them as trendy. By this record, I wanted everyone to look at them as being established and that they know what they were doing.We would get letters back then from kids saying this song changed their lives, whether they were a cancer patient or getting bullied at school. For my career, it's one of the most touching songs I've done as far as the impact it had on fans.Chilli: As beautiful as you are and as much as you have to offer -- I don't mean just the outward beauty, I'm talking like good stuff on the inside -- being in the wrong relationship makes you doubt everything. We've all been there. It could even be a family member that's talking negative towards you and making you feel bad about yourself. So that's one of those songs that again, resonates with so many people. Not just girls, but guys too. Everybody can get that low.For me, I'm a very petite woman, and was never extra developed like how most girls in high school were. I wanted bigger boobs and all that. So that's why when we shot the video, it was personal to me to tell that story. I don't think there's anything wrong with you feeling like you want to get a breast job or reduction. But the most important part is it needs to happen because that's something you want for yourself, not someone else. Not some guy telling you that you'll look better if this was bigger. If they do say that, just drop them. “My Life”Chilli: [Co-writer and producer] Jermaine Dupri is a part of the team. We couldn't put out another record and not have him be a part of it. I always crack up at him because he's not a singer, but he'll try to push those notes out. It's so cute to see him do it 'cause his head kind of cocks to the side and he is just singing all beautiful. He's so creative and has so much energy. It's almost like a little party when we're in the studio working with Jermaine.T-Boz: Lisa loved the media. She thought all press was good press, but me and Chilli don't feel that way. [Laughs.] We didn’t have TMZ [back then]. So if something was a rumor, that meant it went a long way, because it was through word of mouth. [The lyrics] are really about living life in this industry and being a real person, but being looked at as a celeb. You're still a real person even though people don't view you as that. I breathe the same and my heartbeat's the same. I didn’t want my whole life on display. I don’t owe you anything but a song and a dance, because that’s all I signed up for with my contract.“Shout”T-Boz: We got the inspiration from [Tears For Fears’ 1984 single], “Shout.” But this song isn’t a favorite of mine, I’ll be honest. [Laughs.] So when they would do the salsa breakdowns to “Shout” on the FanMail tour, you'll see that I leave the stage and don’t come back until they’re done. I'm such a prissy tomboy. Everyone would get so mad at me, but I didn’t care! Austin: It was fun doing "Shout." The remixed version [which was never officially released] had Enrique Iglesias and Sheila E. on it. I was trying to have a little Latin feel to it -- because it was really kicking in at the time -- while still keeping it futuristic.Chilli: I love Lisa's rap verse on this song. "Shout" and "Hat 2 Da Back" [from 1992’s Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip] are my favorites. She just lost her mind and went crazy. You can just tell when something is personal or truly speaks to a person's spirit when they're recording. So I was really proud of her with how she delivered.“Come on Down”T-Boz: I went into the booth and attempted to do it, because the verses were written [by Diane Warren] for me. I came out and said, “Diane, I’m sorry but I can’t do this!” [laughs] She is an amazing writer, and I love her because she respected my views. I told her to give it to Chili because it was such a sexy song. “Red Light Special” [from 1994’s CrazySexyCool] worked for me, but not “Come On Down.”Chilli: I don't know who she originally wrote this song for, but she told me on the phone that whoever it was didn't want to sing it. I loved everything about "Come On Down" because you know what it's talking about, but it was very nicely subliminal. I loved the country feel of the record, so I couldn't wait. And she was so excited that I wanted to do it. She wasn't actually in studio with me 'cause we recorded it in Atlanta and she was in LA. But I was happy that she was so happy with it. It's definitely one of my favorite songs because I do like a little touch of country. It reminded me of something Shania Twain would do.
“Dear Lie”Chilli: "Dear Lie" also came from one of Tionne's poems, and she worked with Babyface on it. I love it because it's kind of like a metaphor. You can hear a lie that somebody says about you and it's not true. But it can really have so much power over you and that is why it sucks. But you've got to take that power back. We get so caught up sometimes in being upset about things and the person that we're allowing to have that type of power over us are doing just fine and -- as they say these days -- living their best life. T-Boz: Babyface liked this one because I was talking about a lie as if it were a person. My father used to lie all the time, so I absolutely despise liars. So I thought about what I would say if it was a person. I love the way it starts off vulnerable and then turns into a place of strength where you're saying, “I won't let you hurt or unravel me.”“Lovesick”Chilli: It wasn't one of my favorite songs, because being love sick is not good! It's so sad, but that what was going on at the time. And who can't relate to being love sick? Austin: Chilli and I were together back then. One of us was love sick at the time, maybe it was both of us! [Laughs.] The way I used to write for them was to think about if I were them. For this song, we took [inspiration] from both of our perceptions as well as experiences from people we knew.I think that was the first record we cut for FanMail. I remember being at the front desk at the studio and the phone keypad made a blip blip! sound. I thought it sounded cool, so I found it on the computer and turned it into a little rhythm. It's funny because we did the "Communicate" interlude before the song and AT&T hit us up and asked, "Can we use that for a commercial?" I did [that style] on purpose, because if you looked at movies that were based on the future back then -- like Blade Runner -- you always hear that voice telling you what to do. So I took that element and put it into the song.T-Boz: Chilli and Dallas were going through so much at the time! I think Dallas was the one who was lovesick. That song was about all of us, because me and my boyfriend were going at it every five seconds. It was perfect because that's how you feel, especially when [your ex] gets into another relationship and you're not quite over them. It makes you feel better when they girl is not as cute. But don’t let it be a bad chick that’s actually pretty! [Laughs.]“Automatic”Austin: That was me diving back into the Prince element for them. He actually had a song called "Automatic" [from his 1982 album 1999], so I wanted to maintain that Minneapolis sound a little bit. We did that one second because it was connected to "Lovesick."Chilli: I like that song way better than "Lovesick" because it's not sad. [Laughs.] When VH1 used it during the opening credits [for 2013’s CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story film], we just had to make sure they had access to whatever song they needed.T-Boz: We were so excited about that song because a new digital style was just created where you can play a certain sound in the right speaker and another one in the left. We were being innovative because we were among the firsts to do a digital album with all those effects. I love the way the song drifts in and out of the different speakers.“Don’t Pull Out On Me Yet”Austin: I had a leftover TLC song called "Oh Honey" that we didn't end up using for CrazySexyCool because it had that doo-wop feel. It was a little more sensual. So when we got to recording "Don't Pull Out On Me Yet," I still thought we needed to capture that. It was kind of like my interpretation of something Babyface would do. I was also thinking, "How can I get them back to earth a little bit?" [Laughs.] I wanted to bring them from the future and back in the land of songs like "Baby-Baby-Baby" [from 1992's Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip].Chilli: This one has a little bit of a Prince vibe. It's funny how during that era, almost every song you recorded got on the album. You have the ones that are some really good album cuts, and then some are just okay. [Laughs.] You can tell because those are the ones that's usually like number 10, 11 or 12 [on the tracklist].But I think that's a real good feel-good TLC record for that album. This song was a little more mature, because by that time I was a mama. We were in our late 20s and by that time you're conscious of not making some of the silly mistakes that you made when you were in your early twenties. You do grow and you share that with the world, because they're growing too. Even when we're trying something different like on “Don’t Pull Out On Me Yet," it still felt like a TLC record, you know, even though it was a little different. So, you know, we just always made sure that we stayed true to ourselves.

Record in 2009. Instead of approximating this on the kit, he walked out to his car, pulled out tire chains and kneeled on the studio floor. (“Drag on one, smack on two, drag on three, smack on four,” he remembered telling himself.)   
READ MOREHal Blaine, Wrecking Crew Drummer, Dies at 90This ironclad devotion to serving the song flies in the face of technical drumming -- but cemented Blaine in popular music forever. The legendary session man and Wrecking Crew drummer passed away on Monday, (March 11). He was 90.Blaine started out as a teenage jazz drummer in the school of Gene Krupa before indulging his love of rock ‘n roll -- and becoming a seasoned pro by his twenties. And reading his résumé is like scanning 20th century music in miniature. Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and Sam Cooke all made hits with his feel for the groove and tremendous thwack on the snare.When a producer would doubt a band’s drummer could cut it, Blaine was a phone call away. When Terry Melcher wasn’t sure a still-green Byrds could nail their own version of “Mr. Tambourine Man,” he brought in Blaine in lieu of their drummer, Michael Clark. On Beach Boys classics like “California Girls,” “Surfin’ U.S.A.” and “Good Vibrations,” the drummer isn’t original member Dennis Wilson, but Blaine.This drew a variety of reactions from the drum legends. By Blaine’s telling, Clark was “the only guy who was a little pissed”; meanwhile, Wilson was elated. “He was thrilled that I was making Beach Boy records while he was out surfing or riding his motorcycle,” chuckled Blaine.He wasn’t just steady or dependable; he was able to spin slip-ups into gold. His most iconic beat, for the Ronettes’ “Be My Baby,” was the result of a happy accident; when he hit the snare on the 4 rather than the 2 and the 4, producer Phil Spector stopped him cold -- that’s the one. That th-th-thump became the heartbeat of the 1960s.In the 1980s, Blaine’s work dried up -- as gated sounds and proto-digital machines superseded flesh-and-blood players. He eventually stepped away from the kit and became a security guard in Arizona. Later, he lost his Hollywood Hills home and a wall of 175 gold records in a divorce settlement. Still, he penned a memoir, 1990’s Hal Blaine and the Wrecking Crew -- and remained a legend to pop, rock and soul fans who tuned into his singular swing.Blaine claimed to have recorded 4,000 tracks -- and 39 of those shot to the top of the Hot 100. In honor of the late Blaine’s legacy in the studio and the Billboard charts, here’s a crash course on each No. 1 hit he played on.
READ MOREExclusive Video: See How the Studio Magic Happened in 'Wrecking Crew' DocumentaryThe Crystals, “He’s a Rebel” (1962)This ode to a Marlon Brando type makes hay of other 1962 bad-boy anthems such as “Johnny Angel”; instead of riding on frilly harp plucks, this Crystals classic sounds tough, driving and streetwise. Blaine gives this Wild One-flavored hit the horsepower it needs.Shelley Fabares, “Johnny Angel” (1962)“He’s got something that I can’t resist/ But he doesn’t even know that I exiiiiist!” Not exactly love poetry worthy of Neruda, but this fluffy single -- written by Lyn Duddy and Laurie Loman and recorded by Elvis Presley co-star Fabares -- vaulted to No. 1.Jan and Dean, “Surf City” (1963)Hard to imagine now, but the Beach Boys once had surfing competitors that threatened to wipe them out on the charts; Brian Wilson wrote this No. 1 hit for fellow Angelenos Jan and Dean. Today, “Surf City” sounds like an off-brand imitation of America’s Band -- but dig Blaine’s choppy backbeat, and for a moment, you believe.Dean Martin, “Everybody Loves Somebody” (1964)The Rat Pack star’s signature ballad was less a show-stopper than an act of aggression; when he found his son, Dean Paul Martin, worshipped the Beatles, he snapped back: “I’m gonna knock your pallies off the charts.” He did knock “A Hard Day’s Night” down a notch: still, it’s anyone’s guess who remembers “Everybody Loves Somebody” over the Fabs classic.The Beach Boys, “I Get Around” (1964)Sometime around 1964, Brian Wilson quit writing hot-rod rockers and aspired to “pocket symphonies”: the more complex “I Get Around” is the first gasp of a full-fledged composer. Blaine plays less like a garden-variety beatkeeper than part of a greater pop machine.Lorne Greene, “Ringo” (1964)Not a reference to Richard Starkey, but an outlaw gunfighter, delivered in deadpan spoken-word by actor Greene. A period piece to be sure, but a proto-William Shatner moment for anyone’s morbid interest. Blaine gamely follows along with his train beat.Barry McGuire, “Eve of Destruction” (1965)A woke pacifist anthem that encapsulated Vietnam, the Selma to Montgomery marches and the Kennedy assassination, “Eve of Destruction” took an assist from Blaine to capture the 1960s in full swing.The Beach Boys, “Help Me, Rhonda” (1965)“I would have made a better rhythm,” Brian Wilson admitted about “Help Me Rhonda” when asked what song he’d re-do in 2014. “It wasn’t in the pocket.” Beach Boys heads beg to differ: Blaine’s sly shuffle and anxious fills nail the impudence and insecurity of puppy love.Sonny and Cher, “I Got You Babe” (1965)Sonny Bono’s ode to newlywed life has been covered by everyone from UB40 to Mark Kozelek -- and the original remains a karaoke-ready, date-night classic. Blaine’s tick-tocking rhythm marks off the months and years ahead of the married 1960s duo.The Byrds, “Mr. Tambourine Man” (1965)The line on this one is Bob Dylan saying “Wow, you can dance to that!” -- though it’s impossible to imagine anyone dancing to this. Rather, the Byrds’ hit version of Dylan’s tune is even more of a head-trip than the original. Just listen to the tentative demo from Preflyte Sessions to hear how Blaine captured the dreamy pulse like Michael Clarke couldn’t.Gary Lewis and the Playboys, “This Diamond Ring” (1965)This gawky, Beatles-nicking hit by Jerry Lewis’ son hit the charts hard, starting at No. 65 and working its way to the toppermost. Today, this No. 1 hit scans like a charming throwback; Blaine’s dramatic timpani adds necessary heft to a track that flirts with fluff.The Beach Boys, “Good Vibrations” (1966)No way Dennis could have followed along with this one: “Good Vibrations” remains the most Byzantine surf hit of all time. It’s best heard not in verses and choruses, but in episodes: Blaine nails every dramatic shift of Brian’s idiosyncratic, neo-classical masterpiece. Not bad as dogs’ inspiration goes.The Mamas and the Papas, “Monday, Monday” (1966)Blaine plays slack and tambourine-heavy on this Mamas and the Papas hit -- a ray of sunshine famously played at Monterey Pop Festival. It’s hard to hear this light, breezy classic in light of the fate of John Phillips, who succumbed to a tragic life of drug abuse and illicit relations.Petula Clark, “My Love” (1966)Clark famously disliked this tune, calling it “flat” and “ordinary”: she begged Warner Bros.’ Joe Smith not to release it until he simply responded, “Trust me, baby.” Correct assessment: the Wrecking Crew-powered “My Love” was a smash.Johnny Rivers, “Poor Side of Town” (1966)A shooby-dooing curio from 1966, the blue-eyed soul singer’s “Poor Side of Town” rides Blaine’s workmanlike rimshots as Rivers croons from the wrong side of the tracks.Frank Sinatra, “Strangers in the Night” (1966)“The worst f---ing song I ever heard,” spat Sinatra about “Strangers in the Night.” Ol’ Blue Eyes may have just been embarrassed about its scatting chorus, but he protested too much; like “Poor Side of Town,” it doo-be-dooed to No. 1 and remained on the chart for 15 weeks.Nancy Sinatra, “These Boots Are Made for Walkin’” (1966)No kiss-off song is as threatening, as empowering, as funny as “Boots”; Loretta Lynn, Pegi Young, and even Megadeth gave the Lee Hazlewood/Nancy Sinatra classic their own shades of aggression. But Blaine’s clobbering beat on the original is the rightful boot itself.Frank and Nancy Sinatra, “Somethin’ Stupid” (1967)This classic duet was originally going to be a duet between Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood; her father relented when Hazlewood told him “If you don’t do it with Nancy, I will.” This love ballad is complicated by the fact that it’s sung between a father and daughter: "Some people call that the Incest Song, which I think is, well, very sweet!", opined Nancy.The Supremes, “The Happening” (1967)What exactly is “the happening” that shook Diana Ross to her core and took her out of her world? It hardly matters: “The Happening” was workshopped as a theme for 1967 Jud Kinberg crime flick of the same name -- and far outlasted it as a No. 1 hit.The Association, “Windy” (1967)A sunny, lightweight hit recorded at the height of baroque pop, “Windy” isn’t the most urgent or topical song of the Vietnam era -- but still transports listeners to the Summer of Love. And who else but the Wrecking Crew could be its propulsion system?Simon and Garfunkel, “Mrs. Robinson” (1968)Blaine’s rollicking rhythm was perfect for “Mrs. Robinson,” the Simon and Garfunkel classic included in the film The Graduate. When Dick Cavett asked Simon why he invoked Joe DiMaggio instead of Mickey Mantle at the end, his response was genius: “It’s about syllables, Dick.”The 5th Dimension, “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In” (1969)Though more of a kitschy curio than any far-out journey, this highlight from the musical Hair benefits greatly from Blaine’s touch; pensive on the verses, bubbly and excitable on the chorus.Tommy Roe, “Dizzy” (1969)Roe’s fluffy ode to discombobulation features a suitably vertiginous 11 key changes; Blaine hits the snare like he’s slapping a dreamer awake. America was clearly ready to feel “Dizzy” in 1969.Henry Mancini, “Theme From Romeo & Juliet” (1969)The composer of the Pink Panther theme also covered Nino Rota's goopy instrumental theme to the 1968 film version of Romeo and Juliet. Clearly, it worked. However temporarily, it’s hard to believe this bested both prime Beatles and Stones.The 5th Dimension, “Wedding Bell Blues” (1969)A songwriter’s songwriter type who gained critical rather than commercial hosannas, Laura Nyro’s “Wedding Bell Blues” mostly made waves through a hit version by the 5th Dimension. Blaine gives this cold-feet classic its legs with his signature, slack-wristed shuffle.Simon and Garfunkel, “Bridge Over Troubled Water” (1970)It’s a testament to Blaine’s ingenuity that he let Simon and Garfunkel’s delicate show-stopper be; he doesn’t touch the kit once. This isn’t to say he sits “Bridge Over Troubled Water” out: when it hit its triumphant climax, he got on his knees and slashed the studio floor with tire chains. What a finish.The Carpenters, “Close to You” (1970)Or, the one that goes “Why do birds suddenly appear?” Blaine illustrates this eternal Carpenters question by avoiding the snare entirely -- and dropping out for entire sections. We’re all still waiting for the beat to drop on this No. 1 hit.Neil Diamond, “Cracklin’ Rosie” (1970)This No. 1 hit about sparkling wine didn’t lodge in the public consciousness like other Diamond hits -- “Sweet Caroline,” for example -- but has bubbly appeal in its own right. Blaine plays as effervescently as the “store-bought woman” of Diamond’s desiring.The Partridge Family, “I Think I Love You” (1971)The Wrecking Crew often lent its talents to singles by TV bands -- the Partridge Family among them. Cast members David Cassidy and Shirley Jones lead the L.A. vets for this bubblegum ode to dawning love.The Raiders, “Indian Reservation” (1971)The costumed garage-rock hitmakers who yowled “Kicks” in 1966 attempted a rebrand in the ‘70s, punting “Paul Revere” out of their name in favor of the more serious “the Raiders.” Their ensuing single about the Trail of Tears comes off as insincere in 2019, but Blaine gave it a dramatic heft nonetheless.Neil Diamond, “Song Sung Blue” (1972)Diamond always had a high-falutin’ air to his art, whether crowing “Top that!” to Bob Dylan after his Last Waltz set or claiming to have based “Song Sung Blue” off of a Mozart concerto. Sorry, Neil: it’s a fairly standard country tune with a clip-clopping beat from the Wrecking Crew.Cher, “Half Breed” (1973)Did this No. 1 single from the vantage point of a mixed-race Native American age particularly well? Ask Cher: she spent a series of 2014 tweets both angrily defending and frantically apologizing for “Half Breed.” Blaine plays ably on this No. 1, but like “Indian Reservation,” perhaps this sort of caricature is best left in the past.John Denver, “Annie’s Song” (1974)A light-as-air ode to his wife, Annie Martell, that he wrote while vacationing at a ski lift, “Annie’s Song” is a lovely marital ballad that rightfully became his signature tune. Blaine mostly fades to the background: it’s all about the symphonic flair.Barbra Streisand, “The Way We Were” (1974)The title song from the 1973 romantic drama The Way We Were has its own lush, intoxicating qualities -- and the film is rightfully considered a classic today. Blaine, a consummate professional, didn’t miss a beat on this evocative No. 1.The Carpenters, “Top of the World” (1974)Blaine was often tapped in the ‘70s for ornamental, country-pop playing, and he stepped up to the plate for this Carpenters smash. The appeal was there: A cover version by Lynn Anderson had reached No. 74 in August 1973, prompting Karen and Richard to realize they had underrated the tune and finally release it as a single. It hit No. 1 in December.John Denver, “Thank God I’m a Country Boy” (1975)If Denver’s early singles had latent hayseed charm, his 1974 album Back Home Again pushed it right to the front. He laid all the way in on the No. 1 hit “Thank God I’m a Country Boy,” laying down prairie poetry to Blaine’s knee-slapping rhythm.Captain & Tennille, “Love Will Keep Us Together” (1975)Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield’s ode to resilience was more than a hit for Captain & Tenille: it was the best-selling single of 1975. It’s a happy reminder not only of Blaine, but co-leader Daryl Dragon, who left us in 2019.John Denver, “I’m Sorry/Calypso” (1975)The woebegone opposite of “Annie’s Song” and his final No. 1 single before his 1997 death in a plane crash, “I’m Sorry” carries a complicated vibe from a talented hitmaker. Blaine’s supportive, all-toms backing cools the burn of Denver’s marital troubles -- he and Annie divorced in 1982.Diana Ross, “Theme From Mahogany (Do You Know Where You’re Going To)” (1976)The 1975 film Mahogany, about a black woman who becomes a fashion designer, is solely evoked today for this elegant Ross ballad. It was also Blaine’s final No. 1 hit, and it’s almost as though he knew it -- it seems to feature each of his loose, heavily swinging tricks.Whether playing rock, soul or introspective ballads, Blaine’s mission was a simple one: accompany the song. He removed his ego behind the kit -- and gave pop a bounty we’ll never forget.

The 15 songs include "End Game," a rumored collaboration with Ed Sheeran and Future, and the three previously-released numbers, "…Ready For It" (track 1), "Look What You Made Me Do" (track 6) and "Gorgeous" (track 8). The tracklist, which Swift posted on Instagram just hours after it was leaked, is accompanied with a handful of production credits. Taylor is tagged as executive producer and she co-produced the studio LP, her sixth, along with Jack Antonoff, Max Martin and Shellback, while eight-time Grammy and triple Latin Grammy-winning sound engineer Serban Ghenea mixed the project.
The followup to 2014’s global hit 1989, Reputation should enjoy an explosive launch. According to the Associated Press, pre-orders exceeded 400,000 units -- doubling the pre-order numbers for its predecessor a week before its release -- while it became Target’s most pre-ordered album of all time.Reputation is out Friday (Nov. 10). See the tracklist below. Reputation tracklist in full:​1. "...Ready for It?" 2. "End Game" (featuring Ed Sheeran and Future)      3. "I Did Something Bad"      4. "Don't Blame Me"      5.

New Regency co-financed the $52 million biopic, with Graham King producing. Fox was in sore need of a high-profiile release; Bohemian Rhapsody is its biggest opening outside of Deadpool 2 in more than a year.As fate would have it, Disney suffered a major miss over the weekend as the big-budget The Nutcracker and the Four Realms bombed with $20 million in the U.S. after costing $125 million to produce. It is Disney's lowest nationwide debut in more than two years, excluding nature docs. Disney, which commands more than 30 percent of 2018 marketshare, can certainly weather the loss, and will finish the year with high-profile pics Ralph Breaks the Internet and Mary Poppins Returns.
Nutcracker placed No. 2, followed by Tyler Perry's Nobody's Fool, starring Tiffany Haddish. From Paramount, Perry's first R-rated comedy turned in $13.5 million-$14 million, one of the lowest openings of his prolific career.Both Nutcracker and Nobody's Fool drew withering reviews, or a 34 percent and 25 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, respectively. Bohemian Rhapsody certainly wasn't entirely embraced by critics, but it managed to easily rock past its so-so Rotten Tomatoes score of 60 percent and become a crowd-pleaser.Bohemian Rhapsody, chronicling the rise of the iconic British rock band Queen, is the latest music-infused pic to prosper. It came in ahead of the recent $42.9 million domestic debut of A Star Is Born, which has earned north of $165 million domestically to date.The film also survived plenty of drama during its journey to the big screen. Toward the end of production, helmer Bryan Singer was fired. Singer, who retains sole directing credit, was replaced by Dexter Fletcher. Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander, Allen Leech and Mike Myers co-star.Disney's family-friendly, Christmas-themed Nutcracker, an adaptation of the iconic ballet and short story about a girl whose nutcracker doll comes to life, also suffered a troubled production.Lasse Hallstrom directed Nutcracker, although Joe Johnston was brought aboard to oversee major reshoots late last year (Johnston shares a directing credit). Keira Knightley, Mackenzie Foy, Eugenio Derbez, Matthew Macfayden, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren star. American Ballet Theater ballerina Misty Copeland makes her big-screen debut.Nutcracker fared better overseas, earning $38.5 million from its first 45 markets for a global start of $58.5 million.
From Paramount, Nobody's Fool stars Tiffany Haddish as a recent parolee who tries to help her sister seek revenge on the man who bilked her. Tika Sumpter, Omari Hardwick, Mehcad Brooks, Amber Riley and Whoopi Goldberg co-star in Perry's film.Holdovers A Star Is Born, from Warner Bros., and Halloween rounded out the top five. Universal and Blumhouse's Halloween earned $11 million in its third weekend for a sensational domestic total of $150.4 million through Sunday.At the specialty box office, Focus Features' awards contender Boy Erased, the gay conversion drama starring Lucas Hedges, Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe, posted the best screen average of the weekend in its debut on five screens, or roughly $44,000.A Private War, starring Rosamund Pike, opened in opened in four theaters for an estimated screen average of $17,000-$18,000.Sony Pictures Classics launched documentary Maria by Callas, about famed opera diva Maria Callas, in four U.S. cinemas, reporting a screen average of $12,723.Bodied, a rap contest comedy produced by Eminem, chose a somewhat larger footprint, or 14 screens. The film, released by Neon, reported a screen average of $3,609.

But he considers North Country, coming out Jan. 18 -- previewing here with the video for the track "Waiting on Something to Give" -- as his "first official official release.""Back then I was experimenting with all different kinds of stuff," says Burns, who was born in Donegal and now resides in Annapolis, Md., after previous stints in New York City, New Orleans and Chicago. "It was more of an R&B/rock kind of thing, not very focused -- and not very satisfying." In contrast, North Country's blend of Celtic, folk, bluegrass and country, which Burns self-produced in Nashville, felt decidedly more comfortable."North Country is where I began," Burns acknowledges. "It took a long time to get back to this space. I tried to do the rock thing. I tried to do the electric guitar thing. I enjoy playing blues and reggae. But I started off as a folk player, an acoustic player, traditional Irish stuff and all that. I gradually came back to it -- but I think with a lot of growth from everything else I've done."Burns' journey to North Country actually started back in 2012, when he and his family moved to Annapolis and he formed a bluegrass band there. He began writing the songs that would be part of the album, though he notes that self-funding made for "a very slow process." He found Nashville welcoming -- or, as he puts it, "very unintimidating, no negative vibe" -- and North Country features an impressive cadre of guests, including Sam Bush, Jerry Douglas, Tift Merritt, Old Crow Medicine Show's Critter Fuqua, Tim O'Brien, Union Station's Dan Tyminski (on "Waiting on Something to Give") and others."I went to Nashville and started working and just asked people for some suggestions," Burns recalls, "like, 'Who do you like for fiddle or mandolin on this,' and they'd name somebody and I'd get them, and then they might bring in somebody else. Tim O'Brien brought in Sam Grisman to play upright (bass). I remember Sam (Bush) calling me one day from the studio, 'What do you want me to do?' 'Sam, do what you do -- you're Sam Bush!' It was just great to be working with these people and listening to them make the music better."As he prepares North Country for its release, Burns "couldn't be happier" with the way it turned out, or with his decision to return to his musical roots. "There's nothing on here that makes me cringe," he notes. "You're always very critical of yourself and how you sound -- working in Nashville I learned that everybody is like that. But for my taste and my education, I think this sounds pretty good, and I'm thankful for that."

Put that in perspective. It’s staggering when you think about it: one guy with a guitar and loop pedal has become one of the biggest artists in the world. Point that out to the singer-songwriter (with the loop pedal) at the local pub.The difference, of course, is he has hit songs, like “Shape of You,” “Photograph,” “Thinking Out Loud,” “Castle on the Hill” and “Galway Girl;” but the 26-year-old Englishman also shows us what’s possible.Perhaps, more importantly, to old-school music junkies, in this day and age when young people are exposed to singers with no live band and dance troupes; or DJs with laser lights — when sales of guitars are down — here’s a musician that has attained the highest career achievements, solo.
His success has bigger implications. Just like Sheeran was inspired as a kid when his dad took him to see Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney, no doubt there are kids in this audience now wanting a guitar, inspired by him.In Toronto, for his second sold-out night at the Air Canada Centre — and just a few dates into the North American leg of a 180-date world tour that began in Italy in mid-March and concludes next August in Poland — Sheeran unassumingly showed us how.And for those paying attention, what he does is pretty mesmerizing, watching him create his backing tracks before our eyes, playing, recording, looping and adjusting. His seemingly insatiable thirst for water (reaching often to gulp from a plastic bottle) might also be a bit of a diversionary tactic, as he gets each track right.The set list was virtually the same as the previous night, starting with “Castle on the Hill,” then “Eraser” — both from his latest album, ÷ (Divide) — before playing his breakthrough track, “The A Team,” from his 2011 debut album, + (Plus), demonstrating early on not just his prowess with a guitar and loop station, but for singing and rapping. To be sure, this is not a campfire solo acoustic show; there isn’t even a stool in sight. He gets the track then is free to strum, sing, jump on a riser, thump out percussion on the body of the guitar, rapid-fire rap or do nothing at all when he gets the audience to sing back his lyrics for him.His between-song chat wasn’t particularly memorable. He talked about the energy, how loud the previous night was (as well as in Buenos Aires, Argentina). He asked us to put one arm in the air or to get out our cell phones to light the joint. There were a couple of emotional stories when he talked about his grandparents, including the day he drove to see his sick grandmother and she wasn’t there, before playing the song he wrote for her, “”Supermarket Flowers” (his only change from Friday’s set, replacing Justin Bieber’s “Love Yourself,” which he co-wrote).That was a bit of a drag for the many fans who were there both nights. As a solo artist in the truest sense of the word, Sheeran could easily mix it up, reorder the songs or add in others, as well as change the banter, so that he could become one of those “I saw that concert in that city” performers, like a Springsteen where every show is different and special.Set list:"Castle on the Hill""Eraser""The A Team""Don't" / "New Man""Dive""Bloodstream""Happier""Galway Girl""Feeling Good" / "I See Fire""Supermarket Flowers""Photograph""Perfect""Nancy Mulligan""Thinking Out Loud""Sing"         Encore:"Shape of You""You Need Me, I Don’t Need You"

"He was found dead in Muscat, Oman this Friday afternoon local time, April 20th. The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given."
Bergling started out releasing music on Laidback Luke Forum in the late '00s, where DJs and producers would post music and seek feedback from budding peers. In 2011, he broke through to an international audience with the progressive house track "Levels," which hit No. 1 in his native Sweden and on the U.S. Billboard Dance Club Songs chart -- and earned him a Grammy nod. His 2012 David Guetta collab "Sunshine" earned him a Grammy nomination as well, and that same year, he became the first electronic DJ/producer to headline New York City's storied Radio City Music Hall. In 2013, Avicii released his debut studio album, True, which featured the game-changing, massive international hit "Wake Me Up!" ft. Aloe Blacc. Combining EDM, folk and country music, the song became a No. 1 hit in many countries and peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. His second album, Stories, dropped in 2015 and featured vocals from Chris Martin, Wyclef Jean, Robbie Williams, Matisyahu, Brandon Flowers, Gavin DeGraw and more. The EP Avīci (01) came out in Aug. 2017 and featured his Rita Ora collaboration "Lonely Together."
Avicii's health issues were known to the public for several years prior to his death. He suffered from acute pancreatitis, in part due to excessive drinking. In 2014, he canceled numerous shows in order to recover after having his gallbladder and appendix removed. Eventually, he decided to retire from touring entirely in an emotional letter penned in March 2016.“To me it was something I had to do for my health,” Bergling told The Hollywood Reporter in 2016. “The scene was not for me. It was not the shows and not the music. It was always the other stuff surrounding it that never came naturally to me. All the other parts of being an artist. I'm more of an introverted person in general. It was always very hard for me. I took on board too much negative energy, I think.”

By clicking “Accept,” you agree to the storing of first- and third-party cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing effortsYou probably remember 2016 as the year of the Event Album, a seemingly endless stream of huge artists unleashing monolithic statements -- often from out of nowhere, and usually while you were still trying to digest the album dropped by a different megastar just weeks earlier. It was overwhelming enough to make us wonder if this was what every year was going to be like as a music fan: eleven months of hopping from major release to major release, with one month at the end to scramble to sort through it all.Well, 2017 was much more merciful on us. There were event albums, sure, but fewer without warning -- to the point where one of the few legitimately big surprises was literally titled Without Warning (and still announced the day before) -- and not so many that seemed to stop the world on its axis, the way releases from Kanye, Beyonce, Rihanna and more did in '16. But that was fine: It just meant that we had more of a chance to search for personal favorites, and more time to spend with those we found. Not like the stars totally let us down, either -- from commercial breakthroughs to solo bows to artistic rebirths to however the hell we're referring to More Life these days, our best and brightest certainly still made an impact, just without sucking up all the oxygen in the pop universe around them.Between the records that announced their presence with authority to the ones we're still trying to get to come out of their shell, here are the Billboard staff's 50 favorite albums of 2017.50. Kelly Clarkson, Meaning of Life
With some break-up albums, listeners have to read lyrics like tea leaves to deduce their backstory. But on Kelly Clarkson's lushly soulful Meaning of Life -- her first album under a new contract with Atlantic Records, following a lengthy and unhappy tenure at RCA -- the writing's on the wall: not all breakups are bad, and freedom feels damn good. (The gal who sang "Since U Been Gone," canon on the subject, should certainly know.) With both her ceiling-shattering voice and delightfully unfiltered spirit unleashed, Clarkson embraces her Aretha moment without ever losing herself. Turns out that while angsty pop-rocker Kelly was fun, "Whole Lotta Woman" Kelly — who belts her way through an extended metaphor likening herself to a full Southern meal ("Pot full of grits/ I'm hotter than your mama's supper, boy") — is the flat out life of the party. -- REBECCA MILZOFF49. 21 Savage, Offset & Metro Boomin, Without Warning
From the moment the drop introduces 21 Savage's verse on album opener "Ghostface Killers," this trio on the cutting edge of hip-hop's trap-youth movement was completely locked in. Over the past several years, Metro Boomin has proved himself to be an increasingly diverse producer, able to slide in and out of a variety of styles, but at his core he's a painter of horrorscapes, specializing in sparse atmospheres that are equally effective heralding anguished Future hooks or the imminent arrival of Freddy Krueger. It's fitting, then, that he would group the dead-eyed Savage and ominously dexterous Offset, two of the more vividly bleak storytellers around, to annotate his chilling illustrations; the result is incisive in its execution. -- DAN RYS48. Lana Del Rey, Lust for Life
Lana del Rey’s fourth album, Lust for Life, was a breath of fresh air amidst the collective chaos and confusion of 2017. The album ingeniously integrates classic pop-rock beats with trap rhythms that surround Del Rey’s vocals with melodic sensuality. More than a nostalgic play, Lust for Life is a journal of explorations about love and life, a narrative of realism where hope peeps through the curtains of overwhelming lyrical emotion. Del Rey cleverly sets her curiosity on the loose with a multifarious, both in terms of generation and style, guest list: The Weeknd, A$AP Rocky, Stevie Nicks, Sean Lennon and Playboi Carti, giving this tale one of the year's richest supporting casts. -- PAMELA BUSTIOS47. Big K.R.I.T., 4eva Is a Mighty Long Time
After being frozen out by his former label Def Jam, Big K.R.I.T. clawed his way to liberation in 2016. The veteran Mississippi MC sought refuge in the studio and doled out a masterful comeback with the independently released 4Eva Is A Mighty Long Time. His ambitious double album dishes out trunk-rattling anthems like “Big Bank” and “Subenstein (My Sub IV)” and self-reflective records including “Get Away” and “Drinking Sessions," making K.R.I.T.'s third album a must-grab for hip-hop purists. -- CARL LAMARRE46. Jay Som, Everybody Works
An indie-pop breakthrough that feels like the first step on a long, winding road: Melina Duterte, the Oakland singer-songwriter behind Jay Som, exudes charisma and utilizes the type of storytelling that can help project her intimate vocals on a wide screen -- assisted, of course, by some of the year's most aqueous, spellbinding guitar work. Everybody Works not only sparkles, but suggests a songwriter with a lot to say, and many more engrossing projects ahead of her. -- JASON LIPSHUTZ45. King Krule, The OOZ
“I seem to sink lower” are the first words Archy Marshall sings on The OOZ, his second full-length as King Krule. The listener plunges into the muck of the 19-track project alongside Marshall, swimming through lo-fi punk, dub, lounge-lizard jazz—emphasis on lizard. There’s something primal and low to the ground about Marshall’s sound; even at its most artful, his language still feels scooped directly from his darkest 23-year-old dreams (“I got more moons wrapped around my head and Jupiter knows/ Whilst you orbit with some stupider hoes”). But Marshall is brilliant at sequencing, and the gentle conclusion, in particular the brightly strummed closing track “La Lune,” leaves you feeling quiet and calm -- like you’ve only just now realized that, after all this time underwater, gravity no longer applies. You’re submerged, but you’re weightless, too. -- ROSS SCARANO44. Thundercat, Drunk
The artistic multihyphenate -- singer, producer, instrumentalist -- born Stephen Bruner has spent the past decade dotting liner credits of acclaimed projects from Kendrick Lamar, Erykah Badu and Flying Lotus. As a solo artist, now three albums deep with this year's funk-splattered Drunk, the falsetto'd crooner takes listeners to the wood-panel, shag-carpet basement of his mind, cultivating a record of velvet-lined grooves, strutting bass lines and manifestos about getting put in the friend zone. It makes sense that Drunk sounds like the broadband 2017 descendant of yacht rock purveyors Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins -- who even show up to christen their successor with guest verses on centerpiece "Show You the Way." -- STEVEN J. HOROWITZ43. Dua Lipa, Dua Lipa
One hit single does not a superstar make. While international breakthrough “New Rules” continues its scaling of the Billboard Hot 100, it’s the consistently high caliber of English singer-songwriter Dua Lipa’s self-titled debut -- a minefield of potential smashes -- that establishes her as one of pop’s most promising prospects. From the carefree kiss-off “IDGAF” to the smoky, Miguel-assisted “Lost In Your Light,” the 22-year-old Londoner has set a high bar -- one we’re eager to see her vault over in the future. -- PATRICK CROWLEY42. Cashmere Cat, 9
Norwegian producer/DJ Cashmere Cat has developed a sound so specifically his -- cherubic synths, funhouse vocal samples, a proclivity for restrained percussion -- that it's secured him standout placements on LPs from Charli XCX, Britney Spears and Kanye West. It explains why he was able to corral such strong features from megastars The Weeknd, Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande for his full-length debut 9, and also how he still manages to eclipse them all: Throughout the set, he treats his esteemed guests like accessories, dropping them out at key moments to leave space for his fantasy instrumentals to gleam and shimmer. -- S.J.H.41. MUNA, About U
Fresh out of USC’s fledgling pop music program emerged MUNA, a synth-rock trio whose spellbinding debut album, full of queer empowerment anthems and progressive battle cries of love and loss, arrived early in a year where we badly needed all of the above. The exuberant “I Know a Place” -- their all-inclusive, come-dance-the-night-away single -- already feels like a mission statement, their signature song. And in portraying the heartache all sorts of people experience (MUNA purposely avoid gendered pronouns), luminous slow-burners “Winterbreak” and “Everything” poignantly capture feelings still lingering behind closed doors, long after the club closes. -- CHRIS PAYNE40. Demi Lovato, Tell Me You Love Me
Fans already knew Demi Lovato was confident, but she added an entirely new dimension to the word with the absolutely undeniable Tell Me You Love Me. Some might argue that Lovato’s fearless vocal gusto has become a little too in-your-face, but that’s exactly what Lovato’s fans have been waiting for: a record that combines her unabashedly raw lyrics – whether scandalous (“Just tell me when you're ready/ And Imma paint your body with my lips” from “Concentrate”) or heart-rending (“I'm sorry for honesty/ I could not bear to lie to you” from “You Don’t Do It For Me Anymore”) – with her even fiercer octave-scaling. Demi got something she’d been waiting for, too: a "dream collab" with Lil Wayne on “Lonely," though even the rap icon can’t outshine Demi on her most spotlight-commanding album yet. -- TAYLOR WEATHERBY39. Romeo Santos, Golden
In the three years it took for Romeo Santos to follow up 2014's phenomenally successful Formula, Vol. 2, the Latin charts veered from being dominated by his contemporary brand of bachata to being overrun with reggaeton. No matter: Third solo album Golden is replete with fusions, including one urban-leaning track, “Bella y Sensual,” featuring Nicky Jam and Daddy Yankee. But overall, the album is vintage Romeo in its sophisticated, often jazzy chord and tempo changes, adapted to bachata’s trademark guitar and guiro backbone. The lyrics, always Santos’ forte, continue to tread the fine line between sensuality and sexuality; “El amigo,” featuring Santos' hero Julio Iglesias, is an ode to the penis -- the kind of thing only Santos could pull off. -- LEILA COBO38. Charly Bliss, Guppy
Three years passed between the release of Charly Bliss’s 2014 EP, Soft Serve, and the band’s debut album, Guppy. That’s nearly the length of high school, which is exactly what the band’s music may remind you of -- particularly if you started in the mid-'90s and loved Veruca Salt. In that gap, the band tightened up the spaces in its songs and beefed up the scuzzy melodic lines to make Guppy, a no-filler album of 10 concise, joyous pop-punk blasts. There’s an obvious youthful exuberance to Charly Bliss — partly due to lead singer-songwriter Eva Hendricks’s spunky, eternally preteen voice. But the immediacy of the music serves as a reminder that no matter how far your awkward-stage years are in the rearview, you’re never too old to revel in power chords and emotional confusion. -- CHRISTINE WERTHMAN37. Thomas Rhett, Life Changes
After his top 40-crashing love song “Die A Happy Man” opened the doors for the country crooner beyond his genre, he took full advantage of his newfound crossover appeal with his third album. While the singer-songwriter was hardly afraid to push musical boundaries before, Life Changes bounds across American pop history, incorporating doo-wop (“Sweetheart”), R&B slow jams (“Kiss Me Like a Stranger”) and even EDM bass drops (“Leave Right Now”) into 14 relatable tales about, well, life’s changes. And that diversity was rewarded: In September, Life Changes made the Thomas Rhett the first country artist of 2017 to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. -- T.W.36. Rapsody, Laila's Wisdom
With co-signs from JAY-Z, 9th Wonder and Busta Rhymes -- who called Laila's Wisdom "the best album I've heard not only from a female MC but in hip-hop period" -- North Carolina rapper Rapsody trounced the competition on her sophomore album with her scintillating wordplay. First, she flexed her ACC cred on the Kendrick Lamar-assisted song “Power" ("Carolina home boy, you know we keep a Stackhouse") before hosing down her detractors on the swaggering banger “Sassy" ("See these pretty wings, I maxed well"). Last month, the rapper got the mainstream recognition she deserved when the Recording Academy awarded Laila's Wisdom with two Grammy nominations, including best rap album and best rap song for “Sassy.” -- C.L.35. Julia Michaels, Nervous System EP
The landscape of successful pop songwriters-turned-performers is one strewn with dreams dashed and ruled over by, well, Sia. So when Julia Michaels, the prodigy who co-penned hits for Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld and many more, stepped behind the mic, the stakes looked rather high -- until she opened her mouth. From the first bars of "Issues," the breakout first single of her tightly-constructed Nervous System EP, Michaels made her artistic identity clear with her beautifully textured, ultra-expressive voice: a millennial woman who embraces the messiness of her life and displays an alluring comfort with her own sexuality. And "Issues" is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Michaels' emotional range: Whether she's wailing through the crunchy "Uh Huh" like a Lilith Fair vet or oozing regret in "Worst in Me," she manages to blend singer-songwriter genuineness with inventive pop melodies. -- R.M.34. Mura Masa, Mura Masa
There was no need to stress over your Friday night playlist in 2017 -- Mura Masa had you covered. The Grammy-nominated first offering from Guernsey-born beat-slayer Alex Crossan is a 45-minute dance party that spins everything from woozy trap (“All Around the World”) to plush marimba (“1 Night”), with high-profile attendees like Charli XCX, Desiigner and A$AP Rocky all boogieing in their tuxes and ball gowns. Dance world, take note: At 21, the prolific Crossan is poised to become one of the genre’s leading influencers, and his first album’s balancing act of collaborators proves he’s got both the talent and the Rolodex to get himself there. - TATIANA CIRISANO33. Syd, Fin
Odd Future DJ-turned-after-hours chronicler Syd brings a certain dreaminess to everything she touches. That’s largely due to the fact that her voice is the aural equivalent of bedroom eyes, but it's also because she wraps her vocals in slinky, underworld R&B that keeps you warm at night. These were always the dominating sounds on her three full-length projects with her hip-hop soul group The Internet, but on her solo debut, Fin, you get an entire album of Syd’s vibes. “Know” is a playful temptation that makes cheating sound like harmless fun, but she reminds you of her loyalty -- to herself and her people -- on “All About Me.” And then there’s “Body,” which is just, well, hot (“I can hear your body when I / Pull your hair, what’s my name"). Sex might sell, but it’s the all-out sensuality in Syd’s delivery that makes Fin worth the investment. -- C.W.32. Japandroids, Near to the Wild Heart of Life
The ironic thing about the Japandroids third album's title is that on the surface, the freedom-rock duo would seem further from life's blood-pumping central organs than ever: After two albums of now-or-never urgency and calloused-fingers commitment, Brian King and David Prowse finally seem content to burn a little slower and let their view extend a little longer. But just because they don't sound like they're warring against imminent oblivion doesn't mean they aren't still fighting the good fight -- they're just the rare punks who realized they didn't actually hope they died before they got old. Near to the Wild Heart of Life captures Japandroids upon the realization that their travels North East South West don't mean much if they don't have a home to come back to, and the set bleeds gratitude at the realization that they, in fact, do. When you have true love and a free life of free will, the road goes on forever anyway. -- ANDREW UNTERBERGER31. Daniel Caesar, Freudian
Canadian Daniel Caesar’s sacred-versus-secular balancing act recalls the creative fervor of another soul soldier, Marvin Gaye. Belying his 22 years, the independent artist delivers a nuanced, mature and illuminating portrait of love and heartbreak. Between Freudian’s organic fusion of R&B/traditional gospel and Caesar’s naked lyrical honesty, you hear (and feel) the surprise, joy and angst that love entails, as on the ethereal “Get You” (featuring Kali Uchis) and the introspective ballad “Blessed.” It’s no wonder that Caesar’s mellow music and hot-buttered vocals have won fans as legendary as Stevie Wonder -- and netted first-time Grammy nods for best R&B album and best R&B performance. -- GAIL MITCHELL30. P!nk, Beautiful Trauma
With P!nk's seventh album, Beautiful Trauma, gone is the scrappy, neon-haired rebel without a cause we met in 2000; in her place, a tenacious warrior of a mo-ther-fu-cking woman. On standout power ballads “Wild Hearts Can’t Be Broken” and “For Now,” a world-weary P!nk smartly makes a play for the Adult Contemporary crowd. But fret not, P!nk’s sick sense of humor is still in tact on the action-packed, Antonoff-produced title track: “We were on fire/ I slashed your tires/ It’s like we burned so bright we burned out.” -- P.C.29. Tyler, the Creator, Flower Boy
Hip-hop outsider and Odd Future co-founder Tyler, the Creator has spent four albums expressing himself through the guise of various overblown personas, but on his fifth album Flower Boy, it appears that the real deal has finally arrived. With wide-ranging production work that sounds like the culmination of Tyler’s past forays into jazz, funk, and grunge, Flower Boy proves his abilities have officially caught up to his vision. He channels his outlandish tendencies into a seamless set filled with his most thoughtful, confessional bars -- on topics like depression, loneliness, even his sexual orientation -- and deftly selected features from versatile budding talents like Rex Orange County and Anna of the North. Its debut at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 was notable for the 1,000-unit gap that separated it from Lana Del Ray’s Lust For Life at the top of the chart, but more importantly, Flower Boy signifies Tyler’s development as an artist has reached full bloom. -- BRYAN KRESS28. Halsey, hopeless fountain kingdom
Halsey’s sophomore album is an all-inclusive dissection of doomed love, made to sound slightly less hopeless with its dive into dark pop production. Opening with a reading from Romeo and Juliet on “Prologue” (yes, she goes there), Halsey sets the stage for one-act dramas of crumbling relationships (the questioning “100 Letters” and Lauren Jauregui feature “Strangers”) and unapologetic admissions of indecision and imperfection (the burning ballad “Sorry” and Hot 100-bounding standout “Bad At Love”). For a year when mental health in music took a front seat, the way Halsey highlights her romantic history through her own inner turmoil acts as a comforting nod. Her kingdom has an open-door policy, and with nothing to hide, she was free to deliver one of the year’s most mold-breaking pop albums. -- LYNDSEY HAVENS27. Perfume Genius, No Shape
Shimmering, sad chamber pop is a well-worn subgenre, so you can be forgiven for assuming that there's not much left to do with it in 2017. Enter No Shape, the fourth album from art-pop purveyor Perfume Genius. Blake Mills' deft production gives the introspective songs a shapeless, open-spaced aural clarity that gives every celeste, tabla and synth room to flourish. From the quietly explosive "Slip Away" to the mesmerizing "Wreath" to the dreamy, drifting "Alan," No Shape sounds like it was recorded in a world where Oberon and Titania rule, not Trump. -- JOE LYNCH26. Ed Sheeran, ÷ (Divide)
Ed Sheeran took 2017 by storm right out of the gate with two top 10 hit singles from his third record, including the year’s most-streamed track on Spotify, the inescapably catchy “Shape Of You.” Impressive numbers aside, Sheeran’s double-Platinum-certified third album was quintessentially Ed, continuing his effortless one-man show with impressive guitar, singing and, yes, rap skills. But this time, Sheeran brings more diversity than we’ve ever heard from the ginger-haired Englishman before, as he acknowledges his Irish roots (“Nancy Mulligan” and “Galway Girl”), and throws in unexpected African and Spanish flair (“Bibia Be Ye Ye” and “Barcelona,” respectively) -- without forgetting to craft a “Thinking Out Loud” sequel worthy of a Beyonce remix in the waltzing ballad “Perfect.” He may not have an album of the year Grammy nod to show for it, but who needs the Recording Academy when you already have the whole world? -- T.W.25. Priests, Nothing Feels Natural
“Contained chaos” is a rock cliche, but it’s one of the first terms that comes to mind for Priests’ roaring first album, a project that is decisively punk yet ornately arranged with every surf-rock riff, drum roll, bass stab and shriek. The latter is usually coming from Katie Alice Greer, a frontwoman with a keen understanding of soul; Nothing Feels Natural sounds beautifully lived-in thanks to the guttural emotion behind each of her sneers. -- J. Lipshutz24. Kehlani, SweetSexySavage
One of the year's most assured R&B records came from a breakout star fairly new to the genre. Kehlani, the 22-year-old, Oakland-born, tat-covered chanteuse assembled some of the finest songs the style has seen in recent memory with SweetSexySavage, a title that pays homage to TLC's 1994 masterwork CrazySexyCool. But it's in title alone that the hat-tip extends: Her major-label studio debut is crisp and contemporary, its tracks energized and deliciously hook-driven, largely courtesy of production masterminds Pop & Oak. It's the singer-songwriter's forthright approach to these songs that elevates them -- she's at once reflective and ostentatious, lamenting her own romantic missteps on album jewel "Advice" and then warning suitors of her brazen unpredictability on "CRZY." The former gives it depth, but it's the latter that keeps it fresh with each listen. -- S.J.H.23. LCD Soundsystem, American Dream
On LCD Soundsystem’s first studio album in seven years, James Murphy proves that he’s still the most aware, and self-aware, artist in alt-rock. Even the trenchant Father John Misty was blown away by the Grammy-nominated "Tonight," which sees Murphy surgically skewering the Kardashian generation (“These bullying children of the fabulous/ Raffling off limited edition shoes”), then turning the scalpel on himself, “a hobbled veteran of the disc-shop inquisition.” It’s the same impostor-versus-impostor wit -- paired with an insistent disco hook -- that made LCD’s previous singles sui generis gems. In some ways, American Dream transcends the band’s pre-hiatus LPs because on “how do you sleep?”, “black screen” and the title track, Murphy sheds his protective irony to confront some thorny adult stuff: betrayal, mortality, losing his edge (for real this time), and losing a disturbing number of his musical heroes: Alan Vega, Leonard Cohen, Lou Reed and, most of all, mentor David Bowie. To use a phrase of Cohen’s, American Dream is a perfect offering to the spirit of the Thin White Duke and evidence of Murphy’s continued artistic vitality as a no-longer-young American. -- FRANK DIGIACOMO22. Chris Stapleton, From A Room, Vol. 1
Chris Stapleton is a fiery presence on From A Room: Vol. 1, his first of two nine-song albums in 2017. He ignites on eager opener “Broken Halos,” goes bat-out-of-hell with the raging “Second One to Know,” and simmers as part of plaintive acoustic ballad “Either Way,” which features a soaring chorus that plainly illustrates why no man in country music even comes close to him on a vocal level. He’s not the only one in the Room at the top of his game, either; few producers in country or any other genre can match the hot streak that Dave Cobb (two Stapleton albums, Jason Isbell and Colter Wall in 2017 alone) is currently blazing through. -- KEVIN RUTHERFORD21. Drake, More Life
If More Life was any indication, Drake could release an album (err, "playlist") every year for an eternity and fans will still flock to it. His tenth release in nine years (and seventh straight No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart) saw all 22 of its tracks hit the Billboard Hot 100 -- two additional hits brought his one-week total to a record-breaking 24 simultaneous chart entries. But More Life earns its spot as one of the top blockbusters of the year on the strength of its breezy warm-weather sounds (evident on "Get It Together," "Madiba Riddim," and the sublime fan-demanded single "Passionfruit"), and the fresh faces from overseas that Drake brings to the forefront (Sampha, Jorja Smith and Giggs, to name a few). Wasn't just the newcomers that Aubrey invited on his globe-trotting yacht party either -- he even brings out Kanye West for a rare feature in "Glow," Yeezy's only Hot 100 hit of 2017. -- XANDER ZELLNER20. The War on Drugs, A Deeper Understanding
The War on Drugs’ fourth full-length album – and like few rock rock LPs in 2017, it is a true album – plays like a shimmery sativa dream in which the legends of classic rock (Dylan, Springsteen, Petty, Zevon and even Tweedy) emerge from the mist and coalesce into something new and achingly beautiful. Frontman and songwriter Adam Granduciel’s influences are clearly recognizable in the swirl of acoustic and electric guitar, synth, harmonica and tape effects that make A Deeper Understanding a logical, more introspective and arguably superior successor to the band’s 2014 breakthrough, Lost in the Dream. But instead of aping his heroes, Granduciel has seamlessly synthesized their signature sounds with his own, expanding the frontiers of 21st century rock n’ roll in the process. -- F.D.19. Residente, Residente
A musician takes a DNA test and records an album based on the results. Sounds like the premise of a movie, and Residente is indeed an album and film project. The first solo venture by René Pérez, formerly one half of Puerto Rican Latin rap duo Calle 13, sees Residente take a literal journey to his origins (including Ghana, Siberia, Burkina Faso and China), where contributions from local artists -- from Ossetian drums to Chinese opera -- ensure that “each sound, each word” has a reason to be there. It could be obnoxious if it wasn’t so deliciously addictive and subversive. The self-titled album explores the horrors of war in tracks like “Guerra” and dreamy love in the beautiful “Desencuentro,” while Residente continues to marry infectious hooks with the best rhymes in Latin urban music. -- L.C.18. Vince Staples, Big Fish Theory
Vince Staples isn’t one to hold his tongue. The Long Beach rapper has released a project every year since 2014’s Hell Can Wait EP, each with whip-smart critiques of the racism and gang violence that rocked his own upbringing. But on Big Fish Theory -- his second album proper -- Staples looks forward, dissecting the trappings of his own celebrity (“glass shoes ain’t made to walk,” he admits on “745”) and the prejudiced society surrounding it (quipping “Obama ain't enough for me, we only getting started" on "BagBak"). All this is delivered through bass-bloated, house-leaning soundscapes that see Staples breach Detroit techno, so much so that the rapper says he deserves a Grammy for electronic album of the year. Keep at it, Vince -- we’re listening, and learning. -- T.C.17. Future, HNDRXX
If the self-titled album that arrived the week before was more along the lines of "mixtape Future" -- harder, darker, more aggressive -- then this set, featuring collaborations with top 40 fixtures Rihanna ("Selfish") and The Weeknd ("Comin Out Strong"), showed off a more experimental and yet more accessible Future. The soaring melodies of "Incredible," "Fresh Air" and "Keep Quiet" feel like steps towards arena status, while songs like "Lookin Exotic" and "Neva Missa Lost" are extravagant and brooding in turn. The one-two punch of the penultimate "Solo" and finale "Sorry" are among Future's most emotionally-revealing and introspective, showing bold-as-love Future to be one of his strongest incarnations yet. -- D.R.16. Kesha, Rainbow
A nation that loves a triumphal second act got the soundtrack for the #MeToo generation with Kesha Rose Sebert’s heart-exploding third album. After a prolonged, potentially career-killing battle with her one-time mentor/alleged tormentor, Kesha rose like a glitter-caked phoenix on this Grammy-nominated collection of inspirational pop and country anthems about empowerment, determination and a refusal to let the bastards get you down (“Bastards”). Before headlines exploded with endless tales of male misdeeds this fall, Kesha pre-loaded a 14-track playlist about refusing to sit idly by and accept what they say about you (or try to do to you). From the soaring, self-affirming anthem “Praying,” to raucous rockers (“Boogie Feet” feat. Eagles of Death Metal) and downright silly romantic parables (“Godzilla”), the formerly dollar-signed singer finally got a chance to show us all the colors of her rainbow, and they were beautiful. “Don’t let those losers take your magic, baby.” Yeah. -- GIL KAUFMAN15. Paramore, After Laughter
Who wants to waste their years being fake happy? 2013’s self-titled LP brought Warped Tour grads Paramore their biggest Hot 100 hit to date, but frontwoman Hayley Williams was often mired in the stress of an unstable lineup, which almost ended the group for good. Down one longtime member but up another, Paramore regrouped with the sparkling, self-assured After Laughter -- a modern Talking Heads-meets-Tango in the Night masterstroke -- just as much a love letter to their fans as it was to themselves. Williams and company ditched the more commercial-focused rollout of their previous LP, conquered their personal demons, and in turn, got to bask in the glory of their most cohesive album to date. Sure, we can only imagine an alternate universe where “Hard Times” is a bona fide top 40 smash -- it topped out at No. 90 on the Hot 100 -- but After Laughter remains a triumph. Thanks to the set’s limber grooves, heartbreaking lyrics, and ultra-relatable 20-something world-weariness, Paramore decisively proved there’s life after pop-punk. -- C.P.14. The xx, I See You
The long break from The xx prior to third album I See You is the best thing that could have happened to the group’s three members. While singer-guitarists Oliver Sim and Romy Madley Croft cleared their heads after an arduous promotional campaign behind 2012’s Coexist, producer Jamie Smith released an acclaimed solo project, a Technicolor dance album under the name Jamie xx. When the three reconvened, Smith had the confidence to introduce more upbeat tempos to the band’s sound, while Sim and Croft moved into a more mature phase of songwriting within their emotionally complex dialogues. Songs like “On Hold” and “Dangerous” add a sense of playfulness to an already successful formula: The xx are still built around the interplay between their male and female lead and the shuddering beats underneath them, but the writing is wiser, and the sonic palette is now unlimited. -- J. Lipshutz13. Lil Uzi Vert, Luv Is Rage 2 
The ascension of any number of viral teenage sensations in hip-hop made 23-year-old Lil Uzi Vert something of an unlikely elder statesman of the SoundCloud set this year. Luckily, Luv Is Rage 2 showed that the Philly MC was up for the challenge of leading by example. The LP broadcast its maturity with the show-don't-tell acuity of any decent writer, demonstrating Uzi's growth through its impressive variety: He sounds as natural squawking abstractly over beats as nebulous as Playboi Carti's ("Early 20 Rager") as he does trading bars with Pharrell like a couple of bantering rat-packers ("Neon Guts") or embracing his inner Nelly for a breakup song of end-of-summer-camp tenderness ("The Way Life Goes"). And while Uzi's sense of gender relations don't always rise above "She gave me head so I called her a nerd," he also offers a sincere, empathetic "You know I respect her on that level" elsewhere, which basically makes him Man of the Year by 2017 recording artist standards. -- A.U.12. St. Vincent, MASSEDUCTION
Like 2014's St. Vincent before it, MASSEDUCTION finds alternative auteur Annie Clark leaning further into the worlds of synths and electronics to produce a deeply personal yet highly oblique album -- think David Bowie circa Low (where you could tell it was confessional even when you didn't quite understand what the hell he was saying). A number of the songs are career highlights: "Pills" is satirically catchy encapsulation of the opioid crisis era, "Sugarboy" is a gender-fluid banger that riffs on Donna Summer's "I Feel Love," and "New York" is wounded, tragic tribute to the city that's reminiscent of Lou Reed during his rare sentimental moments. -- J. Lynch11. Kelela, Take Me Apart
From the ambitious, multi-part opener, “Frontline,” Kelela’s debut album Take Me Apart is an exercise in knowing what you want, when you want it. The 34-year-old singer-songwriter, newly signed to legendary electronic indie label Warp, is in control -- emotionally, physically, sexually. The desire for control, how one wields it, how it's lost -- these are powerful tropes in R&B, especially from female artists. But Janet Jackson was just 19 when she recorded the most famous album on the subject; Kelela has a particularly grown quality when she sings “It ain’t that deep, either way,” scolding a doddering jumpoff on first single “LMK.” On the outstanding title track, she tells her partner to “take [her] apart,” and her voice shakes itself into multiple watery channels with nothing less than total confidence. “When you demand somebody take you apart, then you’re the boss,” she told The Fader earlier this year. Guess that makes us subordinates. -- R.S.10. Harry Styles, Harry Styles
If it wasn’t clear during his five-year tenure as a One Direction pop heartthrob, it is now: Harry Styles wants to be a rock star. Throughout his 10-track solo debut, Styles hides his arena-ruling inspirations in plain sight, and it works -- from the echoes of The Beatles’ “Blackbird” in the tender “Sweet Creature” to the Bowie-esque grandeur of “Sign of the Times.” Of course, it’s Styles’ own self-revealing swagger that makes the album so electric, as the best moments are also his most confessional: waking up alone in a hotel room on “From the Dining Table” (“Played with myself, where were you?”), or growing apart from a lover on “Two Ghosts” (“We’re not who we used to be”). It’s worth wondering where Styles’ self-titled leaves his 1D-era teenage fanclub, most of whom were decades from being born when the artists he best evokes were at their peaks. But what’s more telling is that he isn’t looking for their approval: If rock stardom in 2017 means staying true to oneself above all -- and letting the screaming fans follow as they may -- Styles is headed in the right direction. -- T.C.9. Sampha, Process
South London singer-songwriter Sampha Sisay’s debut album Process arrived in the first week of February, and it’s perhaps no wonder why three seasons later, it still cannot be detached from those frosty first few months of the year. With deeply personal lyrics delivered through Sisay’s fragile quiver, the 10-track set always gives the impression of stepping on ice that’s just on the brink of shattering. It’s a thrilling suspense that can be bone-chilling when Sampha is isolated to a sole instrumental accompaniment on the nostalgia-heavy “(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano,” or liberating when he soars above a cacophonous squall of synths on “Incomplete Kisses.” Sampha had long established himself through collaborations with contemporary pop pillars like Drake, Solange, and Kanye West, but he makes his most enduring statement on Process by plunging into the bleakest depths of his mind and finding the beauty underneath. -- B.K.8. Migos, Culture
Coming into 2017, it was obvious that the Migos could make and deliver hits, but what the trio really lacked in its collective arsenal on the way to mainstream dominance was consistency. Luckily, Culture checked that box for them, paving the way for the Year of Migos that was to follow -- wherein one, two or all three of them came to dominate the Hot 100 alongside the likes of Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj, DJ Khaled and others. The first half, anchored by "Bad & Boujee," "T-Shirt" (which has arguably the greatest music video of all time) and the Gucci Mane-featuring "Slippery," is a nearly flawless balance of impossibly catchy hooks and engaging, memorable verses, with production that accents each MC's platform equally. But that's hardly to say the second half is weak at all; Zaytoven's piano intro on "Big on Big," the woozy hook on "What The Price," the foreboding intro of "Deadz" and the bounce of "All Ass" are all fantastic. Culture's greatest achievement is simply turning Migos into a formidable, three-headed monster with distinct and beloved personalities rather than just "Quavo and the other two dudes." The world is better off for it. -- D.R.7. Calvin Harris, Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1
"Never let these n---as ride your wave," Quavo cautioned on a Drake hook in March. Three months later, Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1 dropped as Calvin Harris' blissful LP-length repudiation of that mentality, in which he invited all his most famous friends over to share the same electro-funk nostalgia trip to a pop era that may have only occurred in their collective subconscious. The effect of the ten-track set is like attending one of those swank '70s Hollywood house parties from retro pseudo-noirs, too glamorous, star-studded and debaucherous to seem possible in real life. Holy shit, is that Snoop Dogg mixing screwdrivers at the bar? Frank Ocean, since when does he show up to these kinds of shindigs? And I could've sworn that was Ariana Grande we just passed in line for the bathroom. Man, we gotta come to Calvin's place more often. -- A.U.6. Taylor Swift, Reputation
If lead singles were always accurate indicators of the album, then Taylor Swift’s Reputation should have been an exhausting record of cartoonish revenge-pop. But despite some light club-thumping outside of “Look What You Made Me Do,” the first taste from Swift’s sixth album, her dance-floor fury is mellowed by moments where Swift — and core producers Shellback, Jack Antonoff and Max Martin — plays it surprisingly cool. “Is it chill that you’re in my head?” she asks on “Delicate,” downplaying her anxieties until she releases them in controlled bursts on the bridge. “Only bought this dress so you could take it off,” she coos on the sparse and breathy “Dress,” as if casual seduction were always a part of her repertoire.Swift still favors bombast, though: “Getaway Car” echoes the Bleachers-like melodrama of “Out of the Woods,” but this time, fittingly, it’s Swift at the wheel. “Put the money in the bag and I stole the keys/ That was the last time you ever saw me,” she sings, before peeling out. Reputation has its fair share of New Taylor, but there are enough instances of self-awareness, vulnerability, and genuine feeling hiding beneath any too-cool exterior to confirm that the Old Taylor is alive and well after all. -- C.W.5. Khalid, American Teen
Sure, the GPS-directed slow jam "Location" was an inventive and enjoyable surprise hit, but no one expected Texas teen Khalid to drop an instant classic in 2017 – debut albums aren't supposed to be this fully realized, and lyrics from 8Teens who still live with their parents aren't typically this smart. But American Teen is the mélange of '60s soul, '80s synth-pop and 2010s alt-R&B that America never knew it needed, and Khalid's laconic delivery -- like Frank Ocean and Bob Dylan before him -- is the sign of a preternatural talent: Passionate but world-weary, lost but strangely self-assured, naïve but wise. Let's hope the future's foundation is in American teens like this. -- J. Lynch4. JAY-Z, 4:44
The self-proclaimed Michael Jordan of rap proved his jump shot was still automatic when he released his 13th solo album 4:44 in June. After being sacked by the media for his infidelity toward his superstar wife Beyoncè, JAY-Z eschewed his legendary bravado and mustered up the courage to voice his failures as a husband and father to the masses. “Kill JAY-Z” enabled the revered MC to shatter his pretentious ego, while the title track helped him sweep away the skeletons that haunted his much-publicized marriage. When Hov wasn’t roughing himself up, he saved a couple punches for his foes on “Bam,” and schooled hip-hop rookies on the do’s and don’t’s of the culture on “Moonlight" ("Y'all n---as still signin' deals?") His newly crowned opus was rewarded with eight Grammy nominations last month including his first for album of the year, proving that the hip-hop G.O.A.T. is still a title contender. -- C.L.3. Lorde, Melodrama
There’s a moment on “The Louvre,” an early highlight of Lorde’s sophomore effort, where the bottom practically drops out of the song post-chorus, retreating to a hyper-quiet stream of synths that slowly builds with mounting blasts of bass like far-off thunder. Of course, this immediately follows a lyric in which Lorde declares that she’ll “make ‘em all dance” to what she’s broadcasting, a line that might normally signal a dizzying swirl of synth melodies or electronic drops to come, aimed at the back of a festival crowd or radio airwaves.But Lorde is already an artist to fly in the face of convention. Melodrama, like 2013’s Pure Heroine before it, has no interest in joining the top 40 rat race; Lorde’s perfectly content with making it come to her vision of uncomfortably diaristic art pop, even if mainstream radio ends up turning up its nose. By now you’ve heard the story of Max Martin calling “Green Light” “incorrect songwriting," but, much like that and “Louvre,” Melodrama is full of transcendent little moments and decisions that run-of-the-mill songwriters wouldn’t dream of making. Good thing, because we don’t need a Lorde who changes for or with her peers. Maybe she’s a liability, but she’s our liability, and she’ll never be too much for us. -- K.R.2. SZA, Ctrl
When it comes to blurting out her own truths, breakout R&B star and TDE signee SZA has everything but control — and that’s what makes her knockout debut the year’s most unashamedly relatable album. She fluctuates between songs rich in self-doubt (“I get so lonely, I forget what I'm worth,” she sings on “Drew Barrymore”), and affirmations of a woman’s worth (asserting “Pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that” on “Doves In The Wind,” and bringing her world-conquering rapper labelmate to nod along in agreement). All the while, she chronicles her craving for love from herself and from others, as she questions, “Am I doing enough? Feel like I’m wasting my time” on “Prom,” and finds herself as falling into sidepiece behavior on “The Weekend.”By closing track “20 Something,” she’s still not there yet: “Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love… Prayin' the 20 somethings don't kill me.” But in highlighting her own insecurities and revealing her innermost thoughts, SZA found at least one kind of love, in the form of obsessive fandom and rapturous acclaim (her five Grammy nods make her the most-nominated female artist this year). In many ways, SZA comes across no different than any other post-teen who is trying to figure their own shit out, but she does so with the raw realness and admirable humor of a friend who says what you would only think, and who would never judge you at your worst — likely because she’s been there herself. Ctrl not only allowed SZA to embrace her faults, flaws and fierce spirit but also encouraged countless others to celebrate their own in solidarity. -- L.H.1. Kendrick Lamar, DAMN.
Less than 24 hours after DAMN.’s early April release, Kendrick stans concocted a resurrected Christ conspiracy theory about the album from the MacGyver-like materials of a Sounwave tweet, the album artwork, a Spotify photo, and DAMN.’s opening skit. This Reddit gospel foretold of a second project, possibly titled NATION (get it?), that would feature blue artwork (the Crips!) and drop Easter Sunday (“and on the third day, Kendrick Duckworth was raised”). It was highly representative of how forum culture super-processes pop culture (to say nothing of complex geopolitical situations). It was also nonsense.At this moment in American history, we want to believe and trust in someone, especially someone who seems to apprehend the world on a different level. It’s unsurprising that this particular theory cast Kendrick Lamar as Jesus Christ -- he’s currently starring in rap’s Greatest Story Ever Told, about the Compton MC who glimpsed ’Pac and Dre as a child and then grew up to be one of the best to ever do it. Like sports junkies, rap fans obsessively track wins and losses in the competitive quantifying of classic runs and G.O.A.T. rankings; since Kendrick began his work in earnest, with 2011’s Section.80, he hasn’t slipped in the standings.And it is so satisfying to watch him exercise his power. Like when he tells punk-ass Geraldo Rivera “Fuck your life,” before launching into one of the most blistering verses of the year, on Mike WiLL Made-It’s spastically produced “DNA.” Or when he lands the very rare Bono guest verse for “XXX.,” a song about militarized police, Donald Trump, and the rigged deck that is America. Or when he shackles himself to a repetitive writing style on the claustrophobic “FEAR.” only to find greater emotional depth within those self-imposed constraints. Or when he unfolds the prelude to his autobiography, via the fateful intersection of the lives of his future boss and his soon-to-be father on “DUCKWORTH.”Look, this man really raps “The shock value of my success put bolts in me.” It feels like luck to be alive while he’s doing this, even when American life feels like the result of bad luck -- or, more accurately, karma. “Is America honest or do we bask in sin?” he asks late on the album. We all know the answer to that. But we also know that it is the unimpeachable truth that Kendrick Lamar recorded the greatest album of 2017. Now pass the gin. -- R.S.

Katy Perry is confirmed for the show and recently former Idol contestant Chris Daughtry was reported to be joining as well, prompting season 5 victor Taylor Hicks to ask shouldn't a winner fill that role instead?The Domenick Nati Show on Tuesday, Hicks did not seem to really approve of word that his season 5 rival Daughtry might have a starring role on the show's return. Daughter has gone on to have a successful post-Idol career, but still only finished fourth in the competition. "I'm not gonna get into who shouldn't or who should be a judge. If anything, I think a winner should be, personally. Because what you go through to win the show is a lot different than what you go through when you're third or fourth or fifth or tenth," said Hicks. "If they were going to have a judge that's from the show ... I would feel like a winner would be the best suited."
Hicks also said he felt like Idol could probably have waited one or two more years before returning, but added that ABC is a good new home for it and praised the network for doing a good job with their reality shows. When asked whether he would consider joining the new Idol, he said he would. He was also pressed on whether he has already been asked. "I've got some pretty good ideas, we'll see what happens," he said. "I'm just gonna be tight lipped about everything. I'm not confirming or denying it."
