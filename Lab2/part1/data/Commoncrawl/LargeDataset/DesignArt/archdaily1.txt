Between 1945 and 1966, the Case Study Houses program, following the Weißenhof-siedlung exposition, commissioned a study of economic, easy-to-build houses. The study included the creation of 36 prototypes that were to be built leading up to post-war residential development. The initiative by John Entenza, editor of Arts & Architecture magazine, brought a team to Los Angeles that featured some of the biggest names in architecture at the time, including Richard Neutra, Charles & Ray Eames, Pierre Koenig, and Eero Saarinen, among others.Between 1945 and 1966, the Case Study Houses program, following the Weißenhof-siedlung exposition, commissioned a study of economic, easy-to-build houses.

Located in the city's Seine-Saint-Denis district, the village was designed to integrate with the existing urban fabric along the banks of the river. Combining housing and offices with diverse programs, the project spans over 119,000 square meters across its entirety. At the conclusion of the games, the village is designed to become a new permanent community in Paris.French architect Dominique Perrault has revealed the new masterplan and vision for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic village.

Home. Our shelter. Our private space. In an urbanized world with dense megalopolises like Tokyo, Shanghai, and São Paulo, homes are getting smaller and more expensive than ever. If you are claustrophobic, Marie Kondo is your best ally in the quest to earn some extra space.  And even though private backyards have become a luxury for most, our data shows that single-family houses are still the most popular project type on ArchDaily. Why is this? (Especially when it seems incongruous given the reality of today’s crowded cities.) Why do some universities still insist on designing and building houses as academic exercises? Wouldn’t it be more creative—and more useful—to develop architecture in small-scale spaces? Would it be more rewarding to develop solutions on bigger scales?Home. Our shelter. Our private space.

We shared PRAXIS’ ninth issue with you a few days ago, and we are excited to feature their tenth issue today. Entitled Urban Matters, this issue focuses on the challenges hyper-metropolises present – specifically, as editors Amanda Reeser Lawrence and Ashley Schafer comment in their introduction, how “to mediate between expansion and liveability” to define and shape the ever changing, and ever growing, urban condition. Architecture and the urban are encouraged to be in constant dialogue; an interconnected network which balances the macro “environmental, topographic, social/political, and technological” to form, and potentially, uplift the micro urban quality of our metropolises.We shared PRAXIS’ ninth issue with you a few days ago, and we are excited to feature their tenth issue today.

The article shares a brief chronology of how the city was formed and settled – first people occupied high elevations and then moved to the lower regions after the government added the necessary levee infrastructure. Mayne’s new vision sees residents transitioning back to the higher elevations, allowing the lower terrain to return to its natural state. Andrew Colopy terms this move the “reverse-engineering” of the area, and the article is a smooth transition from Jane Amidon’s Ecologue for the Metropolis which introduces several projects exploring “entrepreneurial environments” as a way for natural environments to complement the built developments of urban areas.

For instance, ordinary structures are transformed into ones that, in addition to functioning programatically, also address agricultural needs and even include wildlife circulation corridors. Ordinary structural pile systems now become host to an abundant ecosystem, building surfaces are faceted to include roof top vegetation and a home for birds, and interiors are fully “ecologized” with living wall papers.

Text description provided by the architects. The Agora Theatre is an extremely colourful, determinedly upbeat place. The building is part of the masterplan for Lelystad by Adriaan Geuze, which aims to revitalize the pragmatic, sober town centre. The theatre responds to the ongoing mission of reviving and recovering the post-war Dutch new towns by focusing on the archetypal function of a theatre: that of creating a world of artifice and enchantment. Both inside and outside walls are faceted to reconstruct the kaleidoscopic experience of the world of the stage, where you can never be sure of what is real and what is not. In the Agora theatre drama and performance are not restricted to the stage and to the evening, but are extended to the urban experience and to daytime.

The typology of the theatre is fascinating in itself, but Ben van Berkel, who has a special interest in how buildings communicate with people, aims to exploit the performance element of the theatre and of architecture in general far beyond its conventional functioning. As he recently stated: “The product of architecture can at least partly be understood as an endless live performance. As the architectural project transforms, becomes abstracted, concentrated and expanded, becomes diverse and evermore scaleless, all of this happens in interaction with a massive, live audience. Today, more than ever, we feel that the specificity of architecture is not itself contained in any aspect of the object. The true nature of architecture is found in the interaction between the architect, the object and the public. The generative, proliferating, unfolding effect of the architectural project continues beyond its development in the design studio in its subsequent public use.” (Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos, Design Models, Thames & Hudson, 2006).

The facetted outlines of the theatre have a long history in the work of UNStudio and Van Berkel & Bos Architectuurbureau before that. In this case, the envelope is generated in part by the necessity to place the two auditoriums as far apart from each other as possible for acoustic reasons. Thus, a larger and a smaller theatrical space, a stage tower, several interlinked and separate foyers, numerous dressing rooms, multifunctional rooms, a café and a restaurant are all brought together within one volume that protrudes dramatically in various directions. This facetted envelope also results in a more even silhouette; the raised technical block containing the stage machinery, which could otherwise have been a visual obstacle in the town, is now smoothly incorporated. All of the facades have sharp angles and jutting planes, which are covered by steel plates and glass, often layered, in shades of yellow and orange. These protrusions afford places where the spectacle of display is continued off-stage and the roles of performer and viewer may be reversed. The artists’s foyer, for instance, is above the entrance, enabling the artists to watch the audience approaching the theatre from a large, inclined window.

Inside, the colorfulness of the outside increases in intensity; a handrail executed as a snaking pink ribbon cascades down the main staircase, winds itself all around the void at the centre of the large, open foyer space on the first floor and then extends up the wall towards the roof, optically changing color all the while from violet, crimson and cherry to almost white. The main theatre is all in red. Unusually for a town of this size, the stage is very big, enabling the staging of large, international productions. The intimate dimensions of the auditorium itself are emphasized by the horse-shoe shaped balcony and by the vibrant forms and shades of the acoustic paneling.

The theatre is the most recent culmination of the interest Ben van Berkel has often expressed in exploring attractiveness, as this quotation from a recent publication shows: “The aim of our architecture  is to intensify the gaze, to inspire thoughts and images and thus make it attractive for people to stay longer and return to the places we make for them. Keeping it light and almost scientific is our policy; the ploys invented to intensify the gaze are directly related to the traditional ingredients of architecture: construction, light, circulation, and so on.” (Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos, After Image, 2006). The architect considers the Agora Theatre one of the most challenging projects he has undertaken, resulting in unusual and highly creative inventions, such as the handrail.

Text description provided by the architects. The Agora Theatre is an extremely colourful, determinedly upbeat place. The building is part of the masterplan for Lelystad by Adriaan Geuze, which aims to revitalize the pragmatic, sober town centre. The theatre responds to the ongoing mission of reviving and recovering the post-war Dutch new towns by focusing on the archetypal function of a theatre: that of creating a world of artifice and enchantment. Both inside and outside walls are faceted to reconstruct the kaleidoscopic experience of the world of the stage, where you can never be sure of what is real and what is not. In the Agora theatre drama and performance are not restricted to the stage and to the evening, but are extended to the urban experience and to daytime.Text description provided by the architects.

Text description provided by the architects. Conceived as a series of boxes containing the private family spaces (bedrooms and baths) and a free floating and open main level containing the shared family spaces. The main floor is a series of stepped planes, lifted up above a partial basement, that incrementally steps up and bridges over the rear yard to the garage roof deck. A day lit basement contains guest suites, home theater, and play area.

The approach was to use materials in appropriate ways – concrete and masonry where the building touches the earth, steel for height and span, and a light wood frame everywhere else, resulting in a hybrid system of steel primary members and wood secondary members. The design of the home sought to express as much of the steel and connections as possible.

The dramatic Southern elevation is centered on a three story curtain wall with a perforated steel screen for privacy. On the main living level, a skylight runs the length of the home on the North elevation, maximizing the passage of natural light, despite the building on the lot directly adjacent. The interior and exterior spaces seamlessly engage each other from a wide spanning bridge connecting the main living area to the garage roof deck, making efficient use of this Chicago city lot. The main living level is centered around the kitchen, an elevated area that functions as the command center for the home. The living room comfortably sits on one side of the kitchen, while the dining room sits on the opposite side.

Dividing the dining room from a home office at the front of the house, are three 12 foot tall steel doors hung on sliding tracks from the ceiling. The doors are inlaid with glass portholes of varied sizes and fondly referred to by the home owners as “Swiss cheese” doors. They easily slide away into a pocket allowing them to completely open the office to the rest of the living area. The lower level contains a two story rear foyer with a 18 foot tall wall of casework that’s height stretches into the living room, creating shelving to display objects and art above and storage for coats, gloves, hats and boots below. The lower level also contains a playroom, two guest suites and a home theater. The upper level features the family’s 3 bedroom suites and a small study. The stairs leading up to the roof deck are encased in glass and open to a private roof top garden with dazzling city views.

Text description provided by the architects. The site is a light industrial office park of conventional box buildings primarily from the 1960s and 1970s located in Topeka, Kansas. Cox Communications Distribution Center is the first building within the park to be renovated, as the owner has decided to revamp the entire park over the next several years. With a limited budget, the architects of el dorado were asked to create an innovative, yet simple tone for future development.Follow the break for more photographs and drawings of the new Cox Communications Distribution Center.

When the owner of a Topeka-based contemporary furniture-sales company inherited an outdated light industrial and office park from his father, he set forth to update the park, one building at a time. His first opportunity was created by the park’s anchor tenant, Cox Communications. Due to increased sales in the greater Topeka area, Cox Communications required a new distribution center for their growing inventory. In order to remain within the parameters of renewed lease terms, the owner developed a budget constraint of $80 per square foot.Many buildings surrounding the site are non-descript boxes.  Determined to create a new architectural language for the property, the owner hired el dorado inc to design the warehouse.  As a response to the budget constraints, el dorado inc immediately suggested to work with a pre-engineered metal building system.  After careful research of the system’s constraints and capabilities, a design direction was proposed to meet the project’s program, consisting mainly of an 8,500 square foot open floor plate warehouse.  The program also required an inventory check-out desk as well as a loading dock for incoming supplies.

The project solution, composed of a striking, yet elegant structural bays, implements sustainable strategies which aide in holding energy demands to a minimum.  A soaring cantilever completely shades the long, south metal wall system from the hot, Kansas summer sun.  The generous overhang also provides a sheltered loading and unloading area for service vans. A linear clerestory window allows indirect south light to flood the warehouse—the south shelving aisle does not require electric light during the day.  Linear louvered vents along the base of the north and south facades activate a convection cooling system, allowing outside air to enter the warehouse at floor level, replacing the hot air exiting the building through large roof vents.  Fully integrated fluorescent building lighting creates efficient expanses of indirect site illumination, eliminating the need for additional lighting parking lot pole-lights. Though small in area, the new distribution center for Cox Communications commands a large site presence through elegant proportions, crisp detailing, and smart energy conservation.

In 2008, BAC purchased an awkward, pre-existing 299-seat theater space within its building to house the new Jerome Robbins Theater, an intimate, state-of- the-art performance venue. The existing theater was contained within a concrete box and suffered from poor sightlines, poor acoustics, sub-standard theater technology, complicated circulation patterns, and an un-centered relationship between the audience and the stage.

think!’s redesign focused on optimizing the overall audience experience within the theater while resolving the technical and acoustical issues. Centralized raked seating for 238 audience members accommodates 187 in the orchestra and 51 in the floating balcony. Blue, Baryshnikov’s favorite color, was a natural choice for the color of the seats. Interlocking, sculptural staircases bordering the seating area link the orchestra and balcony levels, creating intuitive navigation and flow in a unified space. The sprung stage is set at floor level and measures 42’ wide by 28’ deep, making it ideal for dance as well as other types of performance. A minimal material and color palette was selected for the space—raw corten steel stair railings reflect the rough concrete walls, while perforated wood, acrylic panels, and carpet create a refined contrast.

Framed between the neoclassical Lillian Massey building to the north and the Queen Anne-style Margaret Addison Hall to the south, the renewal creates a bolder, more welcoming urban presence for the Gardiner. Inside, the interior is completely transformed to prioritize the display of the museum’s collections and to create a memorable, inviting visitor experience.

Inside, the interior is completely transformed to prioritize the display of the museum’s collections and to create a memorable, inviting visitor experience.The addition of approximately 14,000 s.f., creates a new contemporary gallery to host international exhibits of large-scale contemporary works, provides much-needed storage for the expanding permanent collection, and incorporates new studio and curatorial facilities to support the Gardiner’s popular community-outreach programs and its research activities. The design also greatly enhances the museum’s revenue-generating potential with a larger, more accessible retail shop, a rentable multi-purpose event space, and a destination restaurant run by Jamie Kennedy.

This exhibit also provided Kuwabara with an intimate understanding of the inner workings of the institution. When KPMB was selected as the architects for the renewal in 2001, Kuwabara’s first design move was to remove the main stair in the entrance hall. This opened up the ground floor to offer a more generous reception, an expanded museum shop and a new contemporary ceramics gallery. Vertical circulation between floors was shifted to the west with a new addition containing a public stair and passenger elevator. After this key shift, the team of Kuwabara, Blumberg and Rocha then developed an overall design strategy to respond to the Gardiner’s needs and vision for growth.In 2000, Bruce Kuwabara was invited by the Gardiner to design the exhibition Miró: Playing with Fire.

The limestone seamlessly weaves existing and expanded spaces together. Screens of limestone louvers control solar exposure into the upper floors of the west and south facades. The front of the museum is completely re-landscaped with a series of terraced platforms that provide a gradual ascent into the forecourt of the building.

Windows are positioned to provide visual breaks in the public spaces of the museum, and to draw attention to the surrounding context at different scales, from closeup views of the historic facades and pediments of the adjacent Lillian Massey and Margaret Addison buildings to framed sequences of the ROM’s heritage building and new Crystal expansion across the street. On the third floor, the multi-purpose space and terrace create elegant new ‘look out points’ that open on expansive vistas of Queen’s Park, the University of Toronto, and the downtown skyline.

Text description provided by the architects. Located at Trial Bay overlooking the D’Entrecasteaux Channel, the project required an addition of a new living room, verandah, courtyard and garage, along with complete reorganization of the existing dwelling which was built in 1981 and designed by Ray Heffernan.  The new room is projected toward the Channel, in a manner and position that preserves the outlook from the house, and maximises direct sunlight to, and outlook from both. The house was awarded the prestigious 2010 Robin Boyd Award of Australian Institute of Architects. 
Save this picture!
The new architecture departs from the existing ‘holes in walls’ masonry character by achieving the duality of being extroverted and open to the landscape, yet being solid, strong and robust.  Close collaboration between architect and structural engineer ensured smooth fabrication and erection of the precast concrete wall/roof panels for the Channel Room. The panels were workshop formed to control the quality of the natural concrete finish. 
Save this picture!
The existing dwelling’s gable form, external wall lines and timber ceiling were retained. However all internal walls, internal and external openings and all surfaces and fitments have been changed.  Double glazed sliding timber windows and doors combine with tiled floors, solar collectors, integral hot water heating, cross ventilation and rainwater harvesting to achieve an acceptable level of environmental performance, without remote control. 
Save this picture!
Door and window frames are fabricated from select Celery Top Pine, with a secondary jamb to create cross ventilation slots.  All joinery has been fabricated with marine ply for cupboard interiors, and finished with Celery Top Pine veneer doors with solid strikes and edges.  An embedded idea is the creation of a pattern of continuous space and circulation, as a metaphor for the landscape itself.

Defining the City The construction of a city involves how is it defined, understood and experienced. These processes and definitions diverge wildly depending upon one’s location: East or West. Heretofore, western architects have subjected analysis of “The City” in China, indeed all of Asia, to a set of western-privileging universals for both physical and epistemological constructions.

More after the break.For one, cities in the western context are understood and conceived as continuities, grounded in specific historical notions of civilization and progress towards a western-defined “modernity”. The city was therefore evidence of a particular kind of progress, the real-ization of that progress, the “real.” Buildings and streets provides critical evidence of an advanced civilization; it is the summary proof of superiority and mastery over nature. Cities thus define the logical, scientific culmination of civilization’s advance and the inevitable teleological development of western culture (1).

Cities thus define the logical, scientific culmination of civilization’s advance and the inevitable teleological development of western culture (1).We must understand, however, that experiences of Western cities have emerged from radically different historical circumstances that are both defined by and juxtaposed with the current “pre-modernity” of China and Asia (2). For Westerners apprehending the rapid changes in the built city, it is difficult to reconcile a “premodern, ancient, grand China” with the contemporary Chinese city of endless permutations, of mirrored curtain walls and fiber optics. In the language of Rem Koolhaas, Chinese cities are “Cities of Exacerbated Difference” or COED (3). This condition is characterized by growth that causes cities to seemingly explode into zones of radical difference. In this scenario, one area neither resembles nor carries the territorial logic of its neighbor.

Moreover, the implicit critique, almost a lament, is that Chinese cities were once unified totalities, devoid of internal difference and anchored architecturally by a predominant “traditional” style of building. The current paradigm has scarred the “pure” territory of the city with “imported” styles (4). The logical end of this argument is that the “true” identity of the Chinese city should remain rooted in the past; only the West can define modernity and progress.

Again, this assessment fails to recognize that Chinese cities have not erased their past. Rather, the past is fully integrated with the present: it is thus mutable. The signs of the past are internalized rather than built as fixed monuments (6). In essence, the built environment is not the primary conduit to or indication of history. Instead, material culture provides merely one element to mark progression. The true signifier of historical continuity is not material but rather, is written—in dynastic histories, edicts, philosophical tracts and commentary. In short, Chinese language, not buildings, is the primary marker of culture. Another view, that of Dutch architect Neville Mars, asserts that China has erased its past (5).

Sinology is selectively farmed for ideas that support decontextualized critiques of contemporary China (8). In a material sense, much of the drama in China-as-contemporary-progress-run-amok is grounded in the mis-perception of China as a rural-based culture. Historical evidence points to the contrary: China, for most of it’s history, was comprised of urban networks.

These are rooted in 18th century Enlightenment concepts in which China perpetually occupies the space of the past, a supposed antithesis of western progress that assumes (and proves) western superiority in those aspects of culture deemed most valuable (10). The orientalist articulation and calibration of the ”other” places the other in the position of inferiority and requires accuracy and legitimacy to be conferred by western intellectuals (11).

The orientalist articulation and calibration of the ”other” places the other in the position of inferiority and requires accuracy and legitimacy to be conferred by western intellectuals (11).Yet the notion of “pre-modernity” not only privileges a particular type of physical and concomitant intellectual development, but it also presumes the West as the standard (12). Such labeling assumes that all “pre-modern” societies desire identical teleological processes towards modernity modeled on Europe and the U.S. Measuring China according to Western ideas of progress privileges the West which produces a history by the West for and about China (13). China as a philosophical construction, or category, in the West serves as a formulation of antithetical, pre-modern “other” that proves the superiority of western modernity (14).

Moreover, because western cities will always occupy successful modernity, pre-modern societies will necessarily be suspect in their advancement towards a derived modernization. In essence, this is the continuation of colonialism’s conception of center and periphery with all that implies.

The message: “look at how they are ruining their once beautiful traditional cities by incorrectly deploying what we’ve taught them about Progress”—this being the orientalist fantasy of China as exotic specter on the verge of catastrophe.

This questions whether or not all modernities contain varying degrees of hybridization. China, like many societies, shops for those technologies which suit their material progress. Those are combined with indigenous principles and philosophies, producing a result that does not reaffirm the singular Western timeline from pre-modern to modernity.

China has brought our own skeletons out of the closet. Western observers can displace onto China their own fears about the dark side of established, western forms of progress and what this might entail for their own cities (16). Instead, we must acknowledge that new forms of progress can and do emerge from the new conditions in urban China.

The architectural discourse on China, for example, is a glaring example of the continuation of old modes of coming to terms with the Other. In order for architecture to grasp China’s present it must shift its narratives away from tendencies which “traditionalize” China’s unique modernity.

The western concept of the city has been to large degree informed by the philosophy of progress as described by Hegel, in which he describes the trajectory of western history, in terms of progress, as inevitably leading to the advance of civilization. Hegel’s notion of progress places the West, as a metaphysical category, in opposition to the East, or the Oriental world. The West’s ability to form a globe-spanning imperium is evidence of its superiority. Hegel’s philosophy was also informed by a Protestant belief in progress as evidence of God’s will. (Hegel, G.W.F. (Rauch, Leo, tr.) Introduction to the Philosophy of History). 2. This progress, read linearly, culminates necessarily in the West as the apex of development, wherein all other cultures occupy an anterior time, a time “out of history” that marks them as “pre-modern” rather than having made a choice to be non-modern as defined by Western thought (see McClintock on anterior time, 1995). 3. A term first copyrighted by Koolhass, et al in Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping, 2001. 4. For a discussion of style in the Chinese city see Peter G. Rowe, 2002. 5. The Chinese Dream: A Society Under Transformation (forthcoming). Again, what is most important about such texts is that they stand apart and at a great distance from China. This is the crux of orientalism. What the text says, in fact, has more to do with the author than with China’s urban condition. It is important to note that the discipline of architecture in the west has constructed its own version of China and that this is in large part informed by very conservative and out of date views. While the humanities has recently adjusted its approach to how it formulates and conceptualizes China, the intellectual discourse of architecture has lagged behind, having not yet caught up theoretically. It is in a sense, riding the coattails of the “China phenomenon” to produce special effects, a spectacle that in fact more reflects the obsessions and concerns of distant witnesses. This is the second China that has always stood apart from the first. The appendage that China cannot shed because western commentary insists that this stand-in is the real thing. In this sense, China is compelled to be like the Siamese twins, Chang and Eng. If we look at the city in literature, for example, Italo Calvino’s Invisible Cities exhibits a city as a multiplicity of mental constructs that all coexist. This heterogeneous nature is in essence the very marker of what a city is, the gathering place of multiple existences and states of being. Ironically, however, Chinese cities have been denied this multiple aspect by much of western urban discourse and are often leveled into simplistic depictions of physical and political turmoil in opposition to tranquil traditionalism. More nuanced depictions of Chinese cities are to be found in contemporary Chinese literature and film (add examples). 6. Part of reason for this misunderstanding is based on the fact that the specialized and popular knowledge base of orientalism has rendered cities like Beijing as fixed in the past and therefore their monuments are foregrounded above all else. Monuments, then, come to embody the city. The past-located exotic foreign capital is based on monuments while the forward moving post-modern city of the west is determined by an ethos of material and social progress. 7.

Shih, 2001,371-377. 12. Ibid. 13. See Chakrabarty 1992. 14. As described by Shih (2001) the Orientalizing of China as exotic other was a crucial element in the formation of modernity and in fact made modernity possible. This came about by means of an aesthetic and scientific appropriation of China for the purposes of consumption in the west. In this sense, the commodification of culture Jameson speaks of as a defining element of western postmodern culture had already taken place in reference to China as category, or fetish. Chinese culture as image, object, exotic subject was employed as an energizing agent for western cultural transformation. 15. For more on the concept of the non-modern see Prakash, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996. This rejects a linear progression through history from pre-modern to modern as typified by the west. It also rejects what McClintock (1995) calls historical progress as geography, wherein the farther “west” you travel the further up the modernity chain you travel (progress not merely as time but as spatial construct.) 16. A case in point is the horror over the Three Gorges Dam project in which western critiques of China’s dam policies stand in as a post-horror of the destruction wrought by the TVA and in which hundreds of dams were erected and irreversibly transformed the North American landscape. See Reisner, 1986. 1. The western concept of the city has been to large degree informed by the philosophy of progress as described by Hegel, in which he describes the trajectory of western history, in terms of progress, as inevitably leading to the advance of civilization. Hegel’s notion of progress places the West, as a metaphysical category, in opposition to the East, or the Oriental world. The West’s ability to form a globe-spanning imperium is evidence of its superiority. Hegel’s philosophy was also informed by a Protestant belief in progress as evidence of God’s will. (Hegel, G.W.F. (Rauch, Leo, tr.) Introduction to the Philosophy of History). 2. This progress, read linearly, culminates necessarily in the West as the apex of development, wherein all other cultures occupy an anterior time, a time “out of history” that marks them as “pre-modern” rather than having made a choice to be non-modern as defined by Western thought (see McClintock on anterior time, 1995). 3. A term first copyrighted by Koolhass, et al in Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping, 2001. 4. For a discussion of style in the Chinese city see Peter G. Rowe, 2002. 5. The Chinese Dream: A Society Under Transformation (forthcoming). Again, what is most important about such texts is that they stand apart and at a great distance from China. This is the crux of orientalism. What the text says, in fact, has more to do with the author than with China’s urban condition. It is important to note that the discipline of architecture in the west has constructed its own version of China and that this is in large part informed by very conservative and out of date views. While the humanities has recently adjusted its approach to how it formulates and conceptualizes China, the intellectual discourse of architecture has lagged behind, having not yet caught up theoretically. It is in a sense, riding the coattails of the “China phenomenon” to produce special effects, a spectacle that in fact more reflects the obsessions and concerns of distant witnesses. This is the second China that has always stood apart from the first. The appendage that China cannot shed because western commentary insists that this stand-in is the real thing. In this sense, China is compelled to be like the Siamese twins, Chang and Eng.

When we stopped by Steven Holl’s office in New York, Senior Partner Chris McVoy spoke to us about the firm’s latest project in Hangzhou – an International Tourism Complex. The firm has a growing presence in China and, arguably, some of the team’s strongest works (such as their Linked Hybrid and Horizontal Skyscraper) are situated throughout the region. With their most recent win, the firm will redevelop the site of the oxygen and boiler plants in Hangzhou to create a master plan comprised of residential and cultural components.When we stopped by Steven Holl’s office in New York, Senior Partner Chris McVoy spoke to us about the firm’s latest project in Hangzhou – an International Tourism Complex.

Text description provided by the architects. The Yew Dell Gardens Visitor Center is situated within the historic property of the Garden Conservancy.  The project required the rehabilitation of an existing tobacco barn with a program including a reception area, information and tickets sales, gift shop, plant sale area, group tour meeting zone, internet sales office, and storage.  De Leon & Primmer Architecture Workshop were challenged with a modest construction budget of $64/sqf and a tight 5 month design and construction completion schedule.  This design project was awarded a 2010 AIA Kentucky Honor Award.

Preserving the exterior iconic image of the tobacco barn structure, the new facility is designed as a ‘building-within-a-building’.  For economy and energy efficiency, the project utilizes the shell of the existing barn as an independent shade structure, leaving it essentially unaltered with the exception of minor framing stabilization. Working with existing structural bay modules, new conditioned interior spaces are consolidated to one side of the barn interior while unconditioned spaces are designed as covered flexible-use areas.  During low-humidity spring & fall seasons, frameless glass doors can be left open to merge both halves of the barn.  Following state historic preservation guidelines, new construction is clearly differentiated from the existing structure through light-colored interior wood plank surfaces and material contrasts.

The use of light - both natural & artificial - is a key design element that transforms the facility throughout the day, affecting the transparency and visibility of the various programmatic components while amplifying the rustic characteristics of the existing tobacco barn. Acting as either a mirror or a transparent boundary depending on the viewing angle, tempered glass walls reflect & refract sunlight, views, and outer barn walls, emphasizing a sense of spaciousness while allowing the original barn to visually register within interior spaces.  During the evening, the facility becomes a glowing lantern within the gardens, with the outer barn shell expressed though interior light filtering through gaps between the wood siding.

Rooted in the simplicity of regional farm structures and in concert with the client’s priorities for responsible stewardship of the land, the farm complex utilizes simple, passive sustainable approaches that are specifically based on an understanding of the regional climate and the nuances of the landscape. For reasons of both economy and ease of maintenance, sustainable building strategies are decidedly ‘low-tech’, favoring conventional construction methods & ordinary materials over specialized systems. In particular, the project implements strategies that take advantage of the cross-synergies between site & building design, focusing on a holistic approach where both components work as a single integrated system.

Consolidating the various programmatic elements into two large barn buildings and a grain silo (in order to minimize building footprints), the majority of the project site is allocated to the circulation & access requirements of large-scale farm equipment. Because facility water usage is minimal and site landscaping is limited to native & regionally-adapted plants that do not require irrigation, site-wide stormwater strategies focus on returning runoff to replenish local aquifers. Porous, drivable gravel surfaces are pitched to channel stormwater into two ‘rain gardens’ planted with native vegetation. Excess run-off is collected within these basins and allowed to percolate back into the groundwater table. In order to minimize maintenance, building roof gutters are eliminated and replaced with ‘site gutters’, a system of drivable, shallow concrete channel swales aligned below each roof eave, which direct stormwater to the collection basins.

Detail
The two primary buildings (Barn ‘A’ and Barn ‘B’) are arranged to frame an outdoor work courtyard, allowing for the consolidation of outdoor lighting requirements to an internalized site zone and away from the farm complex property perimeter, preserving ‘dark sky’ conditions.Barn ‘A’, with fully enclosed storage & work areas, utilizes a standard prefabricated wood truss frame clad with corrugated metal panels. Emphasizing the layering of construction, building elements that are typically hidden (such as wall substrates, fastening screws & alignment lines) are incorporated as design features and reinterpreted as ‘finish’ materials. Natural light, ventilation and views are provided to all interior spaces through full-height operable windows which working in concert with a whole-house fan to draw air through the building.

Barn ‘B’, a large covered shed used to store both hay & equipment, is clad in a lattice grid of locally-harvested bamboo sourced only 35 miles from the project site. Considered a fast-growing invasive ‘weed’, the bamboo is a material nod to the square-bale hay that is stacked at each end of the barn, while also providing a breathable skin that allows the hay to dry through natural ventilation. Since Barn ‘B’ is an open-air structure vulnerable to wind-uplift forces, the concrete drainage channels below its roof eaves also function as a counterweight through an interlocking detail with the column concrete footings below grade.

Although the project is grounded primarily on passive heating & cooling strategies, several conventional mechanical approaches are used during extreme climate conditions like humid summer months. They include the following: In-slab hot-water coils heated with a wood-fired boiler (renewable energy source from onsite agriculture waste wood) with propane fuel back-up, whole-house ventilation fan, inverter-controlled ductless split system AC unit (a non-CFC-based refrigerant), florescent light fixtures on IR sensors & timers with manual override, low-flow toilet & low-volume water fixtures integrated to an adjacent septic field.

Text description provided by the architects. Winnipeg Centennial Library was originally constructed in 1976 as a three-story building occupying a city block and an adjacent public park.  The existing library, constructed of reinforced concrete exposed to the interior and pre-cast panel exterior, felt very disconnected from its surroundings including the park.  The addition to the library, which began in 2002 as the winning entry in an invited design competition, includes reorganization and expansion of the collections, reconfiguration of the circulation systems, and creation of new social spaces, as well as renovation of the existing library.

Both the existing library, roughly triangular in plan, and green space stand on a below-grade parking garage.  Expanding the library into the park would have destroyed valuable public green space and required costly foundation reinforcement within the parking garage. An alternative was to extend the library upward. Fortunately, the building had the structural capacity to accept an additional floor, provided it was light in weight; it also needed to be re-roofed. Thus, most of the added space is contained in a new, light, steel-framed fourth floor under a new roof.

Because of severe winter conditions, many of the buildings in downtown Winnipeg are linked by a continuous interior tunnel and skywalk system. The library is connected to this system by bridges at the second level. An enlarged two-story lobby, created by removing a portion of the second floor, allows the street-level entrance to the library, as well as a gift shop and café within the lobby, to interconnect with the skywalk.

From this urban intersection, patrons are drawn through the building, along an interior “street” animated by displays and bookselling events, and to the park. At the park edge, new public elevators and an elongated system of stairs and reading terraces tie the largely independent existing floors to each other and to the new fourth floor. The glazed wall of this multi-story space opens every level to light, landscape, and city. All public and collections space is accessible from this linear route. The compact footprint of the addition maintains maximum park space, allowing the library to take advantage of its location, while the highly visible, interactive terraces, an interior topography at the scale of the park, generate a radically new identity for the library.

The library is ordered in strips, in a series of zones that run parallel to the window wall and across the long dimension of the space. The strips accommodate the programmatic components of the library in identifiable categories. The first strip is the park, an integral part of all public spaces in the building. The second is all forms of reading—tables, comfortable chairs, and casual seating. Third is low masses, such as reference collections, help desks, and computer stations, and fourth is high masses, such as shelving running in clear sequences. The fifth category comprises rooms: closed reading rooms, offices and meeting rooms, staff areas, service areas, and book handling access. The strips progress from park to interior, from open to enclosed, from low to high, from areas of greatest public access and interaction to areas of privacy and quiet. This spatial order allows all visitors to see and understand the general arrangement of collections and functions whether they approach from elevators or from reading terraces and stairs.

On the new fourth floor, the non-fiction collection is organized as a single run of clearly indexed material. Various subjects within the collection are highlighted by “focus” areas. These exhibit spaces, which are immediately visible at the entrance to the floor, are intervals inserted into the continuity of the collection to emphasize subjects often submerged within the numerical anonymity of the Dewey Decimal system.

The Aquatic Ecosystems Research Laboratory is located on the northern side of the courtyard. This 5,150 square meter building consolidates interdisciplinary research groups around an atrium that interconnects the four floors of the building. Social spaces are located adjacent to this atrium to reinforce a sense of academic community and to encourage serendipitous interaction between faculty, students and the various research units. Faculty offices, loft spaces / digital laboratories for the student community and a variety of meeting spaces are located on the upper floors, while the large public rooms are located on the ground floor where they participate in the urban life of the campus.

The atrium plays a key role in the sustainable design strategies employed in the Aquatic Ecosystems Research Laboratory. Glazed at the top to bring day-light deep into the interior it combines with generous glazing on the north side of the building and photo sensor controls to minimize dependency on artificial lighting. The atrium also acts as a natural ventilation stack that pulls air into the building, eliminating the need for a conventional mechanical ventilation system. On summer nights the building is naturally ventilated to cool the concrete structure, which acts as a radiant cooling surface during the day, eliminating the need for air conditioning for the three upper floors. The Aquatic Ecosystems Research Laboratory is certified LEED Gold.

“The University of Leicester Engineering Building, the History Faculty and Library at Cambridge, and the residential Florey Building at Queen’s College are much praised by architects, yet hated by the members of the universities that use them. Here Alan Berman has drawn together essays that put the buildings in their historical context while exploring both their radical features and their technical failings. In addition, 22 of today’s most famous architects — including Will Alsop, Norman Foster, Richard MacCormac, and Richard Rogers — explain and partly seek to defend the importance of these radical and controversial buildings. With top contributors and newly commissioned photography, as well as stunning drawings taken from the Jim Stirling archives, this book attempts a serious reengagement with the continuing debate between modern architects and the public.”“The University of Leicester Engineering Building, the History Faculty and Library at Cambridge, and the residential Florey Building at Queen’s College are much praised by architects, yet hated by the members of the universities that use them.

Text description provided by the architects. Concept: The concept of project windows is derived from the idea of traditional Iranian windows (Orosi). These windows consist of small colourful modules of glass that control the intensity of light penetrating inside and create a colourful light and shadow on the inner surfaces.

As the building is narrow in width in comparison to its height, the whole complex is divided into several parts in width and height to gain a balanced proportion. Therefore an initially gained rectangular module is composing the whole form on the main façade. These modules are conveying functions such as the entrance, office and commercial units. Our next task was to design a texture on this transparent façade and the containing modules based on the concept of expanding geometry; an Iranian architectural concept in which one module becomes a base for the formation of a whole complex.

The Idea of Dynamic Urban façade: Light is a significant variable in the facade design of this building. By using the transparent and semi-transparent textures on the glass facade we were able to create different qualities of light with various reflection and angles in the night and day. The night light was also modified through using the artificial lighting system that is in harmony with the form of the building and magnifies the dynamic urban views. Through using this modulation system and the facade design we tried to bring an Iranian theme in interior space with the effect of shadows and turquoise reflection of the modules installed on façade. This effect is always being felt even when the semi-transparent blinds are closed.

Exterior Material Combination: The north and south façade of the building contains two transparent layers of material. The first one includes the same size rectangular modules that are installed with small steel rods and includes the main windows. The outer shell is a 30 by 30 glass module that is covered with sky blue colour inspired by Iranian architectural theme. This outer layer not only brings a colourful effect of shadows and lights inside, but also creates a thermal and light shield for the sharp sunlight of the southern façade. The inner layer of the facade in some parts transforms to a semi-transparent layer that is textured by double glazed windows with sand blast modular patterns on inside. Overall, the main goal of this material combination was to reduce the temperature gained by sunlight about 40%. This climatic need is also modified by using the Sun Energy type of glass windows.

Plan Typology: Site is a 13.5 m by 20 m rectangle in total 16 stories. In this project building two underground floors are allocated to mechanical and service rooms. Ground and first floors are dedicated to commercial units and the upper 12 floors are the official units. The client was eager to have different types of office units with the areas ranged from 50 m2 to 120 m2 .This requirement divides each floor into 2 up to 4 units designed with different areas and facilities but regardless of interior quality of space.

Interior Design Strategy: Natural light in the interiors are absorbed from the main facade windows and series of linear transparent and semi-transparent partitions of glass bricks are installed aligned with the transparent facade windows. This strategy not only creates a unity between the interior and exterior but also transfers the natural light in to the deeper interior spaces.

The night light was also modified through using the artificial lighting system that is in harmony with the form of the building and magnifies the dynamic urban views. Through using this modulation system and the facade design we tried to bring an Iranian theme in interior space with the effect of shadows and turquoise reflection of the modules installed on façade. This effect is always being felt even when the semi-transparent blinds are closed.Exterior Material Combination: The north and south façade of the building contains two transparent layers of material. The first one includes the same size rectangular modules that are installed with small steel rods and includes the main windows. The outer shell is a 30 by 30 glass module that is covered with sky blue colour inspired by Iranian architectural theme. This outer layer not only brings a colourful effect of shadows and lights inside, but also creates a thermal and light shield for the sharp sunlight of the southern façade. The inner layer of the facade in some parts transforms to a semi-transparent layer that is textured by double glazed windows with sand blast modular patterns on inside. Overall, the main goal of this material combination was to reduce the temperature gained by sunlight about 40%. This climatic need is also modified by using the Sun Energy type of glass windows.Exterior Material Combination: The north and south façade of the building contains two transparent layers of material.

In this project building two underground floors are allocated to mechanical and service rooms. Ground and first floors are dedicated to commercial units and the upper 12 floors are the official units. The client was eager to have different types of office units with the areas ranged from 50 m2 to 120 m2 .This requirement divides each floor into 2 up to 4 units designed with different areas and facilities but regardless of interior quality of space.Plan Typology: Site is a 13.5 m by 20 m rectangle in total 16 stories.

Text description provided by the architects. The urban biophillic pavilion, designed by studio d'ARC, is located atop a nineteenth century row house in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The pavilion is a reconstruction of a rooftop greenhouse originally built in 1978. The new pavilion serves as both a garden and common room with indoor and outdoor areas including deck platforms with spectacular views. More photographs and drawings following the break.

This rooftop biophillic pavilion is located in the South Side neighborhood of Pittsburgh, in an area known as “the flats”. This area is a geological product of the alluvial basin of the Monongahela River. This unique basin allows for long vistas and is endowed with ample sunlight. These environmental features made this neighborhood one of Pittsburgh’s oldest developed areas and was an early home for many of the city’s glass and later steel making facilities. The South Side experienced the most rapid growth as a dense residential district of mainly row houses in the later part of the nineteenth century built to provide housing for the workers of the steelmaking industry.

Located atop a nineteenth century row house, the pavilion is a reconstruction of a rooftop greenhouse originally built in 1978 by Ernie and Jan Sota. Inspired by the early bioshelter work of the New Alchemy Institute on Cape Cod and using solar greenhouse principals of steep south face glazing, the original greenhouse was one of Pittsburgh’s first green building projects. The 1978 structure allowed the owners to garden year-round in a dense urban context which did not provide for any ground level plantings. Fresh air and in the winter, excess heat and greenhouse fragrance were delivered to the apartments below through a recycled furnace blower motor.

Made mainly of conventionally framed lumber, wood siding and Kalwall, the greenhouse, after years of continual use, was in need of replacement. The new pavilion’s structural enclosure is similar conceptually to the Russian “Matryoshka” nested dolls -- “a structure within a structure”. The main supporting structure is within and is made of exposed douglas fir while the outside enclosure is made of standard wood construction, glass and terne coated stainless steel. The new structure is built to last using aluminum sloped glazing, insulated glass and stainless steel siding and roofing and uses the same “solar” greenhouse configuration as the original.

In its new form, the pavilion serves as a biophillic garden with hydroponic gardening for the tenants with both indoor and outdoor areas. The pavilion now acts as a common room for the tenants that they can use year-round and includes two outside deck platforms which allow for spectacular views of the South Side flats and slopes, Mt. Washington, and Downtown Pittsburgh. Besides the stunning views that can be seen both from the decks and within through the large windows, the pavilion again provides a space to grow flowers and vegetables using a combination of organic hydroponics and soil.

The pavilion will also act as a supplemental heat source for the apartments (for both heating and hot water). Excess heat from the pavilion and warm earth and plant fragrances are circulated to the apartments below during the winter months. When excess heat is not available or during more temperate weather, filtered intake air is taken directly from the exterior. Intake and exhaust air travels through an energy recovery ventilator (ERV), which will capture 90% of the energy from the ventilated air. The diagram at right shows how fresh air will be captured and sent to the apartments below. This ERV “chimney” or “Urban Snorkel” is a deliberate strategy to capture air up as high as possible to deliver to the apartments. The resultant positive air pressure on the apartments prevents infiltration of the lower quality street level air. Future plans also call for a solar domestic hot water heating system as well as upgrades to the air filtration system to deal with particulates, NO2 and SO2, which are common urban pollutants.

As part of its reconstruction and to demonstrate the owners’ long-standing interest in environmentally friendly building methods and materials, this pavilion integrates many current environmental solutions. The north and south decks use TREX, a high recycled content decking material. Recycled content drywall and recycled ceramic tile are used within the structure. The two outdoor spaces have railings made of recycled content galvanized steel, nontoxic pressure treated framing and TREX decking which provide integrated seating platforms and planting boxes. Greenery is further celebrated through the installation of supersized window boxes at the second floor windows of the building.

Text description provided by the architects. Located along the St. Lawrence river, between the Sillery coast and the Ross coast (towards Quebec's bridge), the project delicately weaves a sequence of diverse experiences and atmospheres, navigating from the boundless visual expanse of the river and the scale of the territory, to the tactile sensory experiences of the human scale. The first concern in this project was to inhibit the motorway system which crossed the ground over its length; the second, was to try to make comfortable this immense space by looking after the concepts of scales and balance, but also while giving a special attention to use local materials and vegetation on the site.

An immense cycle track and a sinuous pedestrian path cross this longitudinal site bringing the user from a cultural pole at one end, to a sport pole at the centre and an interpretation pole at the other end. The journey is punctuated by pieces of contemporary art that interact with the landscape and the urban design. The cultural section of the project gathers four contemporary gardens inspired by the mood of the river - the Quai des brumes, the Quai ds flots, the Quai des hommes and the Quai des vents. The sport section, at the center, is composed by two ground soccer, big open spaces and a multipurpose track. The last section of the project, looking towards Quebec's bridge, is set around an industrial quay rehabilitated to gather services of interpretation and restoration. Composed of an observation tower, a deck connected to the river and a multifunctional pavilion, this section marks an important entry to the site and revives the imaginary of a river pier and its intrinsic structures, turning it into a local visual anchor and light beacon - a significant newcomer to the constellation of industrial relics dominating local landscape silhouette and vistas. Finally, behind sector of Cageux, we find a natural site composed of Amerindian archaeological vestiges and centenaries aboriginal trees. This section is integrated to the rest of the Promenade and has been designed in the continuity of the whole project.

The rich, sublime atmospheres and layered textures of the St. Lawrence River's landscapes are materialised as much with stone boulders, timber assemblies and corten steel thresholds, as with native plants and trees, and as with vapour haze, thick shade, mellow light glows and water reflections. The language is contemporary, simple and elegant. The use of familiar material such as rough wood and local stones and the consolidation of the existing shoreline vegetation give an authentic flavour to these contemporary creations. The reinvigorated vegetation frames views and trajectories, and calibrates spaces and scales.

Respectfully remaining within the historic footprints of the original spirit of the shoreline, the project connects Quebec City with the riversides and with the other coastal cities. It also connects the city with XXI century values and vision. The bicycle networks on both sides of the river and the activity around the belvedere space (future boat connections) strongly contributes to revitalise an important section of the Lawrence River's borders and brings important wellness and economics repercussions to the city and its surroundings.

The innovation on this project stands on how designers manage to push the highway further away, how they were able to release an important piece of land in order to reactivates Quebec City's access to St. Lawrence River and transforms this part of the shoreline into a new inviting and user-friendly environment oriented towards nature, leisure and art. The subtle way the whole project integrates the highway and helps qualify this big infrastructure into a landscaped piece of work allows users to cross and drivers to stop. The project, that qualifies Champlain Boulevard from a highway into a landscaped, permeable urban boulevard, is a strong contribution to the restoration of the uniquely rich and diverse, albeit fragile coastal eco-system. Preserved and integrated as living heritage, the existing vegetation has been consolidated and complemented throughout the scheme by species native to St. Lawrence shoreline natural environment.

Text description provided by the architects. The "Rechter House" in Tel Aviv was originally designed by Zeev Rechter as a single storey home for his family with an orderly arrangement of internally and externally exposed, longitudinal concrete beams which formed the basis for the internal spaces, whilst adhering to the principles of "open planning" that were prevalent in those years. Over the years, an extra floor and a third wing were added to the building in such a way that its original form was hidden and the modern design principles governing its original design were abandoned. As the project's designer, I was asked to cope with a situation where the house had been stripped of its original ideas, disconnected from all of its parts and been used by two, separate families.

The family that purchased this old and neglected building asked me to design them a home that united all of the parts of the dwelling into one, new fully integrated living unit, both in terms of its function and its design style. The main idea behind the project wasn't necessarily to preserve the existing habitat and its configuration, but rather to conserve the spirit of the original design. With this in mind, I redesigned the house's external features and internal spaces.

I preserved the horizontal grid and gave it extra intensity when I divided it into two halves through the use of a spacious double space running its entire length. Within the space, I placed a stair case that consolidated all the masses of the structure into one single unit with a huge bookcase along the entire wall that further emphasized the double space. I zealously preserved the original concrete beams and the broad schematic of the building. The design and placement of all internal spaces, functions and rooms was integrated so as not to deviate from the horizontal grid. I also addressed all the external walls of the house. I made new openings that allowed views from both the outside into the home and from the inside out.

This was done in order to emphasize the length of the lines and the different architectural elements. On the long façade fronting the street, I allowed for a dialogue between the structure and the street by installing vertical, aluminum leaves that move on an axis and allow for a visual connection between the residents of the house and pedestrians in the street, and a blurring of the barrier between the private and the public. The movement of the leaves allows light to enter at differing angles during the day and thus brings life and drama into the highly organized spaces and the restrained architecture.

The choice of materials (such as the concrete floor and exposed concrete beams, iron stairs and railings that underwent a prolonged process of rusting, the repeated usage of the original silicate blocks and various metals placed at differing intervals) was done with great thought and included materials that are not considered "fashionable" so that they will not overpower the architecture and will help form a bridge between the two era's; the first, the original one storey design and the other the new, present day design. With the new design, I tried to write or present a personal and updated version of a private dwelling in the spirit of the modern era and in an international style.

The final result of the architectural design and the new interior design is a reserved and cultured private home with human proportions and spaces that together form a strong and clear form, free of unnecessary decorations and designer "chit-chat" with a clean and moderate form and ideas, that reflect the architectural and social principals that are so difficult to find in today's modern world.

On the long façade fronting the street, I allowed for a dialogue between the structure and the street by installing vertical, aluminum leaves that move on an axis and allow for a visual connection between the residents of the house and pedestrians in the street, and a blurring of the barrier between the private and the public. The movement of the leaves allows light to enter at differing angles during the day and thus brings life and drama into the highly organized spaces and the restrained architecture.The choice of materials (such as the concrete floor and exposed concrete beams, iron stairs and railings that underwent a prolonged process of rusting, the repeated usage of the original silicate blocks and various metals placed at differing intervals) was done with great thought and included materials that are not considered "fashionable" so that they will not overpower the architecture and will help form a bridge between the two era's; the first, the original one storey design and the other the new, present day design. With the new design, I tried to write or present a personal and updated version of a private dwelling in the spirit of the modern era and in an international style.

Text description provided by the architects. In the shadow of the cathedral the protected building is since the 17th century pharmacy and a home. Expand wishes for the pharmacy made looking to expand the house. To connect the adjoining apartment to the attic floor offers the solution. Intensive discussions with the service heritage results in a integration into the sensitive historic urban texture.

Shed roofs are connecting the bays of the historical roof trusses with the side lying flat. They bring light and space in the heart of the new house. The support functions of the house are grouped in the former apartment. This makes the attic fully opened and the trusses are restored to their value as defining elements in the space. Two contemporary sink dormer give the house a new identity restored. They open the closeness of the attic without compromising the historical character of the city.

This article was originally published on November 9, 2015. To read the stories behind other celebrated architecture projects, visit our AD Classics section. Angkor Wat is just one of dozens of extant Khmer temples in the Angkor area of present-day Cambodia, but it represents the apex of a building tradition that spanned five centuries, and the height of Khmer power and influence in the region. It is the largest temple complex at Angkor, and intricate bas-relief sculptures line the sandstone structures exemplify the apex of Khmer artistry. Although it has been in continuous use since its construction in the twelfth century, aspects of its history remain unknown. As archaeologist and anthropologist Charles Higham explains, “Curiously, there are no direct references to it in the epigraphic record, so we do not know its original name and controversy remains over its function and aspects of its symbolic status.”[1] Originally dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu, the complex was later converted to Buddhist use (the word “wat” typically refers to Buddhist monasteries[2]), and continues to be a site of religious pilgrimage today.This article was originally published on November 9, 2015.

King Suryavarman II began construction on Angkor Wat shortly after ascending to the throne in 1113. Royal succession in the Khmer empire was typically a violent affair, and Suryavarman's ascent was no exception. He killed his great-uncle in battle to seize the throne. However, inscriptions detailing Suryavarman’s rise to power describe him uniting two previously opposing factions, leading to a period of relative unity and stability.[3] He also continued the tradition of the previous kings, building Angkor Wat, a new royal temple complex, distinct from those of his predecessors.[4] Although the names of any architects or designers are lost to history, it is likely that Suryavarman’s chief priest and spiritual advisor Divakarapandita was highly influential in the temple’s construction.[5]King Suryavarman II began construction on Angkor Wat shortly after ascending to the throne in 1113.

Some archaeologists suggest that 90% of this area was originally occupied by a city surrounding the formal temple precinct, including the royal palace, all built of wood.[7] Today, all that remains are the temple buildings, constructed of sandstone and laterite, a type of local clay that hardens quickly when exposed to air and sun, used primarily for foundations and internal structures.[8]In contrast with many of the other temples at Angkor, Angkor Wat faces west, a reflection of its dedication to Vishnu, who rules over the western quadrant of the compass.[6] A wide rectangular moat surrounds the complex, and just inside the moat an outer wall defines an area approximately 1,500 meters east to west, and 1,300 meters north to south–the largest temple area in Angkor.

Two small stone buildings, known as “libraries,” flank the causeway near the midpoint. Despite their name, these buildings would have been shrines of some kind, not storage for manuscripts.[9]From the western gateway of the outer wall, a long causeway leads to the main temple precinct. Two small stone buildings, known as “libraries,” flank the causeway near the midpoint. Despite their name, these buildings would have been shrines of some kind, not storage for manuscripts.[9]The temple itself consists of two of the primary elements of Khmer architecture: the pyramid, and concentric galleries.[10] The pyramid takes the form of three stepped terraces, with each step bordered on all sides by covered galleries. At each level gateways in the galleries indicate the pathway to the central shrine, and towers punctuate the corners. The pyramid culminates in five towers–an indication of the temple's central shrine.The temple itself consists of two of the primary elements of Khmer architecture: the pyramid, and concentric galleries.[10] The pyramid takes the form of three stepped terraces, with each step bordered on all sides by covered galleries.

The pyramid culminates in five towers–an indication of the temple's central shrine.The entire complex symbolizes the Hindu beliefs enshrined within. As Freeman and Jacques describe, “It is, above all else, a microcosm of the Hindu universe. The moat represents the mythical oceans surrounding the earth and the succession of concentric galleries represent the mountain ranges that surround Mount Meru, the home of the gods. The towers represent the mountain’s peaks, and the experience of the ascent to the central shrine is, maybe intentionally, a fairly convincing imitation of climbing a real mountain.”[11] Historian Eleanor Mannikka’s research has also indicated that dimensions and building elements at Angkor Wat correspond to “calendrically and cosmologically significant totals.”[12]The entire complex symbolizes the Hindu beliefs enshrined within.

In total, Angkor Wat contains nearly 2,000 square meters (20,000 square feet) of bas-relief, in addition to the extensively carved lintels, friezes, and pediments, and the nearly 2,000 apsaras (celestial dancers who entertain the gods) carved throughout the complex.[13] The majority of the sculptures depict the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. The bas-reliefs at Angkor Wat also include a series on Suryavarman II, the first known depiction of a Angkorian king and his court.[14] In addition to the intricate carvings, remnants of paint, and even gold leaf indicate an even more dazzling appearance (although it is not known if these elements were original or added later).[15][16]To further emphasize the Hindu symbolism, the galleries are lined with bas-relief sculpture carved into the sandstone.

The temples at Angkor are often depicted as the ruins of a failed society, but in reality the rise of Theravada Buddhism led to the construction of wooden temples that have not survived, and as Freeman and Jacques put it, “The Khmers never forgot the existence of their monuments, and even if they neglected the majority of their temples, Angkor Wat always remained occupied and a place of worship.”[17]In the decades following Suryavarman II’s death, King Jayavarman VII brought Buddhism to Angkor, and converted many of the temples, including Angkor Wat, to Buddhist use.

The proposed extension to the Central University Library by EXHIBIT Architectura in Cluj Napoca, Romania is an exercise in the design of a contemporary civic, monumental structure among historic, and grandiose institutional buildings.

In a video by Studio Banana, Copenhagen-based BIG's founder Bjarke Ingels speaks to the firm’s design ethos and development. Known for their experimentation with bold and playful forms, the firm has produced some of the most recognizable works of the last decade including the 8 House complex in Denmark and Via 57 West in New York. In the video, Ingels points to communication as the key to success in the field, calling its power analogous to an artist's hammer and chisel. He also draws comparison to Darwinian concepts of evolution, noting that BIG's migration of ideas and iterative design development reflects a similar selection process. He applies this notion, along with another important principle to the firm--sustainability, to discuss works such as their Danish Pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai Design Expo that examines sustainability and experiential architecture.

Text description provided by the architects. What happens when the concept of a project is reduced to a façade in the process of its development? Are purely aesthetic aims valid in architecture? Is façadism something worthwhile? Are we to become architectural dermatologists?

A client contacted us to design a hotel for corporate suites in Nápoles, a residential neighborhood in Mexico City that has been rapidly converting to office use over the past few years. The plot was located across the street from the convention center of the World Trade Center, by far the busiest office building in the city. The suites were intended to accommodate businesspeople visiting the WTC and the year round expositions.

One of the biggest complaints of caffeine-charged traveling businesspeople is that no matter how hard they try to avoid it, their daily lives eventually turn into a boring and tedious routine: wake up at 5:30 am, take a cab to the airport, a Starbucks coffee while waiting at the gate, a tasteless omelet in the plane, a cab to the same forgettable hotel, meeting at 9am, business lunch, afternoon meetings, drinks, back to the hotel, sleep, wake up at 5:30am, catch the flight back… and so on. Their lives seem filled with sameness. 
Save this picture!
This motivated us to create a hotel where every recurring visit would be a completely different experience in an attempt to break their drudging routine. Every suite would have a different floor plan and spatial arrangement. The different shapes were then assembled like a giant Tetris to form a vertical tower. The tower culminates with the last shape left in a cantilever to generate suspense… The assembled shapes were then raised to provide an entrance to the building. To further accentuate the specific character of the suites, each shape was conceived of a different material: wood, metal, volcanic stone, marble, ceramic, limestone, glass… 
Save this picture!
When the construction of the building had begun, the client suddenly changed his mind and decided that from an operational point of view it was too complicated to have 15 different suites. He wanted only two types of suites, the single and the double height. We were shocked. 
Save this picture!
He encouraged us by letting us know his decision was bitter-sweet. The bitter part was losing the original concept and the sweet part was that we could maintain the façade because he really liked it. 
Save this picture!
We had to find a way to adapt the floor plans and reorganize the interiors without sacrificing the façade. In the end, the client got his hotel and we kept our façade.

KSEVT will have emphasized public significance and will generate social, cultural and scientific activities.In the KSEVT building that replaces the existing object of the multifunctional arts center there will be an abundance of social activities, with fixed and temporary exhibitions, conferences and club/study activities. The building will therefore be intended for the local population, as well as guests of exhibitions and participants of international symposia and conferences. In the club area at the top of the building researchers of the history of space technology will be able to focus on their work, removed from the activities in the lower part of the building. The building is a monolithic structure, freely positioned on the allotment between the main road on one side and the stream with a green hinterland on the other. The exterior and interior of the building are determined by two low cylinders. The bottom one is larger and rises from the North to the South, while the upper one is smaller and it joins with the larger one on the southern side and rises towards the North. The bottom cylinder is supported by the transparent surface of the entrance glazing. The spatial relationship between the two cylinders creates a dynamic effect, which is even more accentuated by full glass rings around the building.

The spatial relationship between the two cylinders creates a dynamic effect, which is even more accentuated by full glass rings around the building.The effect of floatation and rotation of the building on its southern and western side towards the road and the entrenchment into the surface on the other side towards the stream and hill creates an impression of memorable importance of the building in this area, as well as its connection to its immediate surroundings. The spatial effects give the building its most distinguishing feature – the effect of artificial gravity due to floatation and rotation. The building has two entrances – the main one to the central space from the square in front of the building on the southeastern side and the northern entrance from the gravelly surface above the stream. The main entrance covers the overhanging part of the larger cylinder. Through this “tight” space, past the circular vestibule with a reception, we enter the interior of the hall. The vestibule can be separated from the activities in the hall by a curtain. The entrance glazing can be completely opened and can connect the activities in the hall with the square. The circular hall for 300 people is surrounded on both sides by a semicircular ramp. This marks the beginning of the exhibition area, which continues from here to the interior of the overhanging part of the larger cylinder. On the west side, along the ramp, there are smaller office areas. Ascending on this ramp also represents a transition from the bright space of the hall to the dark exhibition area. The separated vertical connection with a staircase and a large elevator connects the exhibition area directly to the vestibule of the hall. The exhibition space continues through the landing between the elevator and the staircase to the smaller cylinder, the multi-purpose hall, an auditorium which is raised like a terrace above the hall. From here there is a vertical view of what is happening below. The smaller cylinder is concluded at the highest, northernmost part with the club area – the library, the most intimate part of the entire building.

Text description provided by the architects. In the small town of Ibaraki, 25km outside of Osaka, Japan, stands one of Tadao Ando’s signature architectural works, the Church of the Light.  The Church of the Light embraces Ando’s philosophical framework between nature and architecture through the way in which light can define and create new spatial perceptions equally, if not more so, as that of his concrete structures.  Completed in 1989, the Church of the Light was a renovation to an existing Christian compound in Ibaraki.  The new church was the first phase to a complete redesign of the site – later completed in 1999 – under Ando’s design aesthetic.

For Ando, the Church of Light is an architecture of duality – the dual nature of existence – solid/void, light/dark, stark/serene.  The coexisting differences leave the church void of any, and all, ornament creating a pure, unadorned space.  The intersection of light and solid raises the occupants awareness of the spiritual and secular within themselves.

The employment of simplistic materials reinforces the duality of the space; the concrete structure removes any distinction of traditional Christian motifs and aesthetic.  Besides an extruded cross from the east facing façade, the church is composed of a concrete shell; the concrete adds to the darkness of the church by creating a more humble, meditative place of worship. As a testament to minimalist architecture, the crosses void in the east facing wall is the only prominent religious symbol present in the church.

Formally, Ando’s Church of the Light is minimalist and reductive of religious paraphernalia to a simple cruciform extrusion, which is often criticized as disturbingly empty, void, and undefined.  Although it has been stated to be nothing more than six walls and a roof, there is a whole level of design aesthetic implemented by Ando and his contractors that is misread and unrecognized by the occupants.

As a modern, minimalist structure the Church of the Light emits an architectural purity that is found in the details.  The reinforced concrete volume is void of any and all ornament that is not part of the construction process.  The seams and joints of the concrete are built with precision and care by master Japanese carpenters, along with Ando, that have worked to create an immaculately smooth surface and accurately aligned joints.  So much so, that the seams of the concrete formwork align perfectly with the crosses extrusion on the east side of the church.

The concrete construction is a reinforcement of Ando’s principal focus on simplicity and minimalist aesthetic; however, the way in which the concrete is poured and formed gives the concrete a luminous quality when exposed to natural light.  Ando’s decision to place the cross on the east façade allows for light to pour into the space throughout the early morning and into the day, which has a dematerializing effect on the interior concrete walls transforming the dark volume into an illuminated box. Ando’s approach to light and concrete in the Church of the Light, as well as his other projects, has a surreal effect that perceptually changes material into immaterial, dark into light, light into space.

“In all my works, light is an important controlling factor.  I create enclosed spaces mainly by means of thick concrete walls.  The primary reason is to create a place for the individual, a zone for oneself within society. When the external factors of a city's environment require the wall to be without openings, the interior must be especially full and satisfying.” –Tadao Ando

The 13,000 hectare area south is Moscow is to be developed by the Masshtab company, led by Maxwan Architects of Rotterdam for the urban planning concept of the A101project.The Block City is a masterplan for the area to be built up. It envisions the introduction of standard sizes for urban blocks that can be interchangeable with flexibilities in their typologies and phasing at various stages of the project’s completion. The first phase of the project to be realized is 157 hectares with 12 million sqm of housing of the Block City area. The following proposals are winners for the design of the urban block.

More on the winning projects after the break.The first of the project by SVESMI and CIE, Six of a Kind, qualified for the low density category of Block City with 14,000 sqm of housing and a block size defined at 75 x 125 m. The proposal attempts to subdi-vide the block into smaller scaled objects. This strategy for low density housing creates a division be-tween urbanism and suburbanism, as though the apartments can be subdivide into individual villas within a vertical block. The scheme is composed of six small towers with a continuous band that demarcates the edge of the street from the interiority of the block. This approach provides privacy for the collective resi-dence of the six blocks and provides each building with solar access, views and private parking. Private gardens on the first level of each block open out into a central spine of a collective park for the entire block.

The heights of the towers are variable, depending on density requirements. Taller towers will be oriented to the north end of each block to maximize sunlight hours. Between each tower there are gaps that allow light and air to enter the block’s interior and provides small view corridors into and out of the block.

The composition is easily recognized as an urban unit that makes a clear distinction between private and public space. It follows scale of a five-storey standard Soviet layout with its traditional proportions improved and its apartments suited to contemporary lifestyles.

Truly sustainable construction projects do not solely focus on environmental performance, but also incorporate aspects of innovation, economic feasibility, architectural quality and above all social impact. These so-called five target issues serve as the basis for the adjudication process of the Holcim Awards competition for sustainable construction projects and visions. Naturally, each project has its own focus, but to be successful in the competition they have to perform well in all five target issues.Truly sustainable construction projects do not solely focus on environmental performance, but also incorporate aspects of innovation, economic feasibility, architectural quality and above all social impact.

This is demonstrated with the winner of the Holcim Awards Silver 2005 for Asia Pacific. The project focuses on an eight-legged concrete spider which proved to accelerate coral growth in degraded reefs. Destructive fishing practices, pollution and other damage together with climate change are severely impacting the coral reefs. Marine biodiversity and fish stocks have dwindled causing significant impacts not only on the oceans, but also on local communities who rely on fishing for food and economic development. The project designers found that concrete is an ideal material not only for making the framework strong and resistant to the elements, but also due to its low acidity which favors accelerated coral growth. The young corals can therefore be soon harvested and successfully transplanted to other areas.

Income from tourism supports fishing families and generated additional economic activity and the local community, who were initially skeptical about the coral reef rehabilitation project are now convinced that there is income in environmental restoration and conservation. With this experience, environmentalists and other lobby groups would have better chances of disseminating environmental restoration and protection techniques to other communities e.g. the concept of implementing Marine Protected Areas (MPA’s) which is often acceptable to coastal townspeople of the country.

The original use of the building included a large vehicular elevator accessing all floors for the installation of automobile windshields and glass. This large vertical shaft yielded an extremely inefficient existing floor plate, while 50% of the existing square footage occurred below the street level. 
Save this picture!
The design of the project rectifies these inefficiencies by locating a new vertical circulation core within an addition directly adjacent to the existing building along with much needed occupiable square footage within a new penthouse level. This new circulation core allows for the reclamation of the floor area previously occupied by the existing elevator and gives it over the new residential and retail spaces. 
Save this picture!
These additions are separated both in plan and in section with a ribbon of glass and framed within a folded plane providing a clear distinction of the new program while celebrating the existing building’s historic qualities. A total of 15 unique residential units were created within a much more efficient floor plate utilizing new modern finishes to again contrast and showcase the existing massive existing structural elements of the original building.

The four retail spaces have direct access from the main public pedestrian path, providing much needed activity to the district. Private parking under the building and newly created outdoor space for the residents gives this urban mixed use development much of the conveniences rarely found in a center city development.

This large vertical shaft yielded an extremely inefficient existing floor plate, while 50% of the existing square footage occurred below the street level. The original use of the building included a large vehicular elevator accessing all floors for the installation of automobile windshields and glass. This large vertical shaft yielded an extremely inefficient existing floor plate, while 50% of the existing square footage occurred below the street level.The design of the project rectifies these inefficiencies by locating a new vertical circulation core within an addition directly adjacent to the existing building along with much needed occupiable square footage within a new penthouse level. This new circulation core allows for the reclamation of the floor area previously occupied by the existing elevator and gives it over the new residential and retail spaces.

A total of 15 unique residential units were created within a much more efficient floor plate utilizing new modern finishes to again contrast and showcase the existing massive existing structural elements of the original building.

Text description provided by the architects. Located on the north lawn of the United Nations campus, in New York City, the UN Interim Canopy is a Porte Cochere, designed by FTL Design Engineering Studio. The structure sits adjacent to the UN’s new temporary General Assembly building, designed by HLW International. The design serves as an entrance pavilion and security screen for the general assembly delegates. The structure is envisioned as a relocatable building which is intended to be moved to another part of the campus at the completion of the renovation. Follow the break for more photographs and drawings of United Nations Porte Cochere.

Joe Schedlbauer, Amedeo Perlas: The design explores lightness as a visual, physical and sustainable approach, using a minimum of materials to reduce its environmental impact. FTL seeks to build responsive structures that contain spaces which inspire, where building, nature and people can meet. Drawing its inspiration from the surrounding landscape the canopy is nested within the campus landscape utilizing the contours of site as a visual buffer. Helical arches undulate and twist along the length of the roadway gently peeling away from the main building.

The renovation of the historic UN buildings is scheduled as a five year project. Due to the temporary nature of the interim buildings the environmental impact and sustainability of the Porte Cochere was a prime interest for the UN and was considered at outset of the design process. Realizing these concerns FTL introduced the concept of relocatablity. Why recycle parts when you can recycle an entire structure?

Steel and Cable Schedules
The Porte Cochere may be relocated to another location on the UN campus or to any other site of the UN’s choosing. With this as a starting point, the design developed to have minimal anchorage points and to be modular in nature, using prefabricated steel trusses allowing for quick installation which minimizes the impact of construction crews on site. The high-tech textile membrane’s function is two fold; it provides support as a working tensile element equally distributing structural loads and defuses sunlight to naturally illuminate the space below. The structure uses two fabrics, a Teflon coated glass fabric as the main fabric and a silicone coated glass fabric for greater translucency in the arches. Functionally the canopy provides shelter for the motorcades as they load and unload delegates, requiring ventilation for the idling cars inside. The open facades and linear vents that run the entire length of the trusses allow fresh air to flow freely throughout the enclosure.

The Porte Cochere offers an elegant counter point to the rectilinear architectural elements which inhabit the site. This temporary addition to the long history of the site is at once an suggestion of ideas that speak not only of the present but look forward to the future possibilities of the United Nations, it’s mission and what humanity may achieve.

New Harmony Grotto, by METALAB Architecture + Fabrication, is a reinterpretation of avant garde architect Frederick Kielser’s Grotto for Meditation. With the growing genre of architecture generated by biomorphic design and biomimetic processes, a reevaluation of Kiesler’s work is ever more timely. During the mid-20th century he became increasingly occupied with the relationship of structure and natural form in architecture. The Cave of the New Being (also known as the Grotto for Meditation), proposed in the 1960s for New Harmony, Indiana, represented the designer’s pièce de résistance, embodying all of the intellectual currents of his era, from surrealism to biotechnics, yet it was never realized.New Harmony Grotto, by METALAB Architecture + Fabrication, is a reinterpretation of avant garde architect Frederick Kielser’s Grotto for Meditation.

The terrain presented three conditions that determined the actions taken that would finally define the project. Because of the lot being of triangular shape located in a corner, the legal edification lines left the constructible area in the center, a steep incline of 40%, and finally, sun exposure and views towards the valley.

The operation consists in separating the architecture program into two overlapping volumes parallel to the terrain lines, so when seen in section both volumes relate to the landscape. The lower volume is buried in the terrain and adopts a materiality that allows you to understand it as a socle that blends with the landscape as well as the stone walls that enclose the site. In this volume the bedrooms connect with the garden that exists over the street level below.

The upper volume lies over it, by abstraction it differs from the stone socle and the terrain. In order to do this, we worked with simple geometry dressed in one only material with industrial shaping and a neutral color (gray stone). The volume breaks to prevent views towards the quarry orienting them to the valley.

Located along the narrow side, the pedestrian door, a wide steel plate, slight but of apparent heaviness, gives entrance to a cut of air that extends along the site, limited by the high neighboring wall and the even higher internal façade of the house; it is a gorge of light with the sufficient width to saturate with clarity each of the house precincts. The one that enters the house dwells this open air, that draws their views up to the east side of the sky. Beams of light, at entering, reflect planes of clarity over the long adjoining wall.

Interior spaces are ordered with economy and give way to each other on a linear functionality.

Dubbed Cubby House, the project is filled with reclaimed materials, features transforming spaces that define multiple functions, and has reflective views that increase indoor natural lighting.Edwards Moore’s stunning renovation of an existing apartment in Fitzroy, Melbourne that creates more available space by stripping away dividing walls and focusing on the concept of continuous living space called “Raumplan”, which was developed by architect Adolf Loos in the 1920’s. Dubbed Cubby House, the project is filled with reclaimed materials, features transforming spaces that define multiple functions, and has reflective views that increase indoor natural lighting.Adolf Loos was a Czech-born Austrian architect famous for his essay Ornament and Crime, where he argues that unnecessary décor should be punishable as if it were a crime. Loo’s other popular theory,”Raumplan,” is based on the idea that instead of dividing a house up into rooms by adding walls — a house should consist of one continuous arrangement of living spaces. Edwards Moore rid Cubby House of walls and doors providing a floor plan with enhanced flexibility and sustainability.

Edwards Moore rid Cubby House of walls and doors providing a floor plan with enhanced flexibility and sustainability.The project’s intent was to enhance and add an extension to an already existing apartment overlooking a public swimming pool. Edwards Moore maximized floor space on the first floor and provided an extra floor that houses a bedroom and bathroom. The design studio wanted to connect the interior spaces to the exterior by developing ways to reflect the views of the neighborhood outdoor pool into the interior.

Edwards Moore maximized floor space on the first floor and provided an extra floor that houses a bedroom and bathroom. The design studio wanted to connect the interior spaces to the exterior by developing ways to reflect the views of the neighborhood outdoor pool into the interior.The lower level of the house is designated for mainly public use. Edwards Moore raised the original ceiling to allow room for the injected elevated kitchen floor. The kitchen platform is the first step for the staircase, which wraps up from behind the kitchen island and along the window wall. The stairway is supported by a rhythm of pillars that cast interesting shadows from views coming in from outside. The lobby entrance encased inside a gold box also serves as storage for wine bottles and acts as a privacy screen for the powder room. The wall adjacent to the entry is covered completely by a built-in bookcase that extends along the length of the whole wall from floor to ceiling.

The top floor is filled with light from the skylights above and from the windows overlooking the pool outside. Once arriving from the stairs, the bedroom wardrobe creates a corridor walkway to the bathroom. Glazed panels in the bathroom reflect the natural light coming from the circular skylight for a heightened natural light experience. The bedroom wardrobe is wrapped in three OSB panels and has a gold reflective front that can rotate to create a new small study or guest bedroom space. There is also an outdoor terrace on the upper level that is intimately connected to the bedroom space and is designed to enhance natural ventilation throughout the house.

The designers stuck to a fairly neutral palette with occasional pops of saturated color from natural wood sources. The materials include reclaimed limed timber, OSB, sisal, vic ash and finalizing the floors with white concrete.Edwards Moore designed Cubby House’s interior to have high polished sharp lines contrasting with rough and tactile surfaces.

Consequently, the priority objectives to be attained by the solution adopted are: a) Uniqueness and representation. The building must become, in the Outer Harbour, a landmark and focus. b) Functionality and flexibility. Both in the conception of space and structure design and facilities, the aim was versatility and adaptability for future changes as needed. c) Intelligent building and "high tech " architecture. Provide the latest technologycal innovations, both in materials and facilities, setting an "intelligent building"and placing it within what is known as "high tech" architecture. d) Economy, Maintenance, Exploitation. Achieve a long-term economic investment based on the construction quality and ease design, reducing maintenance and operation costs. To achieve those objectives, we have adopted the following criteria basic design: 1. The building as a container. 2. Diaphanous spaces and transparency. 3. Energy efficiency.

Text description provided by the architects. This museum is located on the Louisiana State Capitol grounds adjacent to the historic 1932 Capitol Tower and Gardens and presents to visitors a comprehensive history of the state. The museum’s siting establishes biaxial symmetry with the State Library across the street and along the central organizing axis of the Capitol Master Plan, which terminates in the Tower to the north. The museum can be approached from either of these two directions, where visitors converge at a large, covered terrace – a kind of over-scaled “porch”– that opens to the north to provide framed views of the Capitol and Gardens.

The envelope of the building is composed of cast-in-place concrete, glass and metal wall panels. The building facades respond to the adjacent context and vary from highly articulated to the east (where the site abuts a residential neighborhood) to a more restrained and purposeful composition on the remaining facades within the park. The metal wall panels on the west façade transition from solid to perforated at the entry terrace, where the simple cubic volume gestures toward the Capitol. The perforated screen wall serves to filter the harsh western sun into the terrace and also acts as a scrim, changing in character from a shimmering, silvery object by day to an enigmatic, glowing presence at night.

The project has reached Financial Close. More images and complete press release after the break.SHCA, part of a consortium lead by Sir Robert McAlpine in the UK and BCM McAlpine in Bermuda, has designed a building to support the highest quality of acute care health service possible on the island, combining clinical excellence with a strong Bermudian character. Architecturally the building is in harmony with the site and achieves high sustainability levels and LEED score, providing a therapeutic environment for patients and exemplar working conditions for hospital staff.

Architecturally the building is in harmony with the site and achieves high sustainability levels and LEED score, providing a therapeutic environment for patients and exemplar working conditions for hospital staff.The upper levels of the building are organised around a central four storey atrium with skylights – a naturally lit volume which serves as a central element about which the inpatient bedroom floors are arranged. This has allowed the development of inpatient bedroom floors that are subdivided into “neighbourhoods” or small clusters of rooms arranged about this central atrium. The atrium is a positive distraction, bringing natural light into the building centre and serving as a landmark to enhance patient wayfinding. The floor of the atrium contains Surgical Reception, Waiting area and Stage 3 Recovery.

The analysis of the building distribution on the island identified a pattern of pavilions which appear to ‘float’ within the landscape. The facades concept for the new hospital has been broken down and scaled in a manner try to emulate this metaphor of “Floating Pavilions within the Landscape”. As a result the scale of the new building integrates with the surrounding context and is further enhanced by the selective use of strong colour on the exterior envelope, common to Bermuda.

Text description provided by the architects. This project was born of a collaboration with the visual artist James Turrell to create a cylindrical skyspace on a hilltop site at a historic winery in Sonoma, California.  The skyspace is an enclosed room which balances natural light from an oculus with a hidden source of artificial light.  The constantly changing light and spatial effects challenge the viewer's familiarity with the mechanisms of perception, creating a heightened awareness of the act of seeing.

The skyspace is 18' in diameter by 35' high, and accommodates twenty people.  It incorporates an existing watertower on the lower level and is nestled in a hilltop stand of trees overlooking the Sonoma valley.  The elevation of the skyspace to the second story was necessary to bring the oculus above the existing tree canopy, preserving a clear view of the sky while permitting close proximity to the adjacent old-growth oaks and madrones.  The tower is clad with Sonoma fieldstone from the vineyard and references the historic construction of the winery, the oldest Pinot Noir vineyard in America.  The stonemason who set each lichen-covered stone single-handedly worked on the tower for five continuous months.

The skyspace is sited such that it is not immediately perceptible from the distance as an object, but rather as a timeless, enigmatic structure that might be accidentally encountered – half man-made, half natural, integrated into the lightly wooded landscape.  It is reached by a winding path from a clearing, and a steep ascent up its crisply abstract cast-concrete stairs.  The detailing of the tower, both exterior and interior, was guided by a desire to minimize the evidence of construction and typical cues of human scale.  The proportions within the space – the oculus and room diameter, ceiling, bench, and door height – are all guided by the necessary workings of the skyspace as a precise optical device.

The curved teak benches at the perimeter of the skyspace were fabricated by a boat-builder, and house a ring of programmable L.E.D. lights in a hidden trough.  During the transition from twilight to full night, the lights are programmed to change in intensity as they wash the underside of the canopy, creating a changing perception of sky as space, form, object and void.  A high-point of the show occurs at equiluminance, when the brightness of the sky matches that of the ceiling.  A different sequence is programmed to reward those who arrive to witness the dawn.

The project conceptually fuses architectonic form with the natural elements of the site. Positioned between a salt meadow marsh, a pine forest, and the bay, the architecture is conceived to be at one with the water, the horizon, and the sky. The idea of an elemental architecture is explored in the relationship between the simple form of the building and the agrarian structures that dot the surrounding area.

Hooper’s Island occupies a land mass less than 1 meter above sea level.  In 2003 a storm surge from Hurricane Isabel destroyed many of the houses on the island. As a result of the destruction, FEMA and the Dorchester County Zoning department established an ordinance requiring that all new residences be built three feet above the base flood elevation.

The local vernacular of the barns and fishing shacks which had survived the hurricane, provided inspiration for the new house which was elevated to the required height using plinths made of black ground face concrete masonry.  The plinth foundations are tectonic constructs that result in an opportunity to create above-ground structures: the outdoor shower, the swimming pool and the fire pit.

The house is used with various degrees of frequency and intensity depending on the weather and the number of guests. For this reason, the house is composed of several separate cabins that can be locked down or conditioned and inhabited as needed.   Although the cabins are individual buildings, they are linked visually by the exterior metal cladding and coplanar sloped roofs.

The three main structures that comprise the house are the master cabin, the guest cabin and the lodge.  The master cabin and lodge are articulated as metal and wood tubes that cantilever off the plinths, minimizing the incision in the earth required for their footprints.  Each building is oriented to take advantage of specific views across and down the Honga River.   The guest cabin is located between the lodge and master cabin and has a roof that protrudes above the main roof to act as an abstracted light fixture, greeting visitors as they approach.

Positioned between a salt meadow marsh, a pine forest, and the bay, the architecture is conceived to be at one with the water, the horizon, and the sky. The idea of an elemental architecture is explored in the relationship between the simple form of the building and the agrarian structures that dot the surrounding area.

In 2003 a storm surge from Hurricane Isabel destroyed many of the houses on the island. As a result of the destruction, FEMA and the Dorchester County Zoning department established an ordinance requiring that all new residences be built three feet above the base flood elevation.

As a result of the destruction, FEMA and the Dorchester County Zoning department established an ordinance requiring that all new residences be built three feet above the base flood elevation.The local vernacular of the barns and fishing shacks which had survived the hurricane, provided inspiration for the new house which was elevated to the required height using plinths made of black ground face concrete masonry.  The plinth foundations are tectonic constructs that result in an opportunity to create above-ground structures: the outdoor shower, the swimming pool and the fire pit.

The plinth foundations are tectonic constructs that result in an opportunity to create above-ground structures: the outdoor shower, the swimming pool and the fire pit.The house is used with various degrees of frequency and intensity depending on the weather and the number of guests. For this reason, the house is composed of several separate cabins that can be locked down or conditioned and inhabited as needed.   Although the cabins are individual buildings, they are linked visually by the exterior metal cladding and coplanar sloped roofs.

The master cabin and lodge are articulated as metal and wood tubes that cantilever off the plinths, minimizing the incision in the earth required for their footprints.  Each building is oriented to take advantage of specific views across and down the Honga River.   The guest cabin is located between the lodge and master cabin and has a roof that protrudes above the main roof to act as an abstracted light fixture, greeting visitors as they approach.

Text description provided by the architects. Two basic principles guided our project for the construction of a new penthouse foor to house a single 234-square-meter apartment, located at the base of  the Corcovado Mountain in Rio de Janeiro's forested Jardim Botânico neighborhood. The first was a demand for an open space with the least possible amount of internal subdivisions, with the intent to provide good cross ventilation and establish continuity between the interior areas and the surrounding landscape, particularly the Atlantic Rainforest located right in front of the four-story building. Our solution was to group together personal and service areas (bedroom, bathrooms, laundry room) in one block that runs along the east façade, thus creating an open space for the rest of the apartment that connects the front terrace all the way to the back terrace. The open space accommodates the kitchen, dining room, living room, entrance stairs, and study.

Such layout gave the interior space a more  longitudinal reading. As a counterpoint, a geometrical volume holding the building's large water tank was inserted across the width of the ceiling. The added volume is visually emphasized by its lower ceiling height and different surface treatment. It is further detached through a skylight, which makes the entire continuity of the volume visible from the inside.

At the north end, which holds the living and dining rooms, a system of pivoting doors placed across the entire 8.80-meter width of  the apartment allow for complete opening of the space, promoting direct contact with the Tijuca Forest and the remarkable statue of Christ the Redeemer at its mountaintop. The second principle was to use renewable resources wherever possible. The building's old asbestos roof was  replaced with a green roof, which reduces both the thermal effect of the sun's radiation into the apartment and its refection back into the atmosphere. This solution, allied with the allowance of cross ventilation, eliminated the need for air conditioning in the penthouse apartment.

In addition to its heat and noise reduction benefits, the green roof can be accessed directly from inside the apartment and serves as a garden to be enjoyed by its residents, including the possibility to grow a vegetable garden and an area to create compost from organic waste. Solar panels were installed at the highest point of the building for water heating. The abundant natural lighting provided by the large window openings  in all four façades was intensified by the addition of skylights. These skylights were designed with a system that permits constant air circulation and keeps the environment comfortable.

A deactivated cistern in the building's underground floor was repaired to store rainwater collected from the roof, which can be reused both for watering the plants and cleaning the external areas of the building. The formal solution adopted meets the requirements  imposed by the public authorities regarding the insertion of a new volume on an existing building, particularly since it is located in an officially protected area of cultural property (Jardim Botânico's APAC - Área de Proteção do Ambiente Cultural).

The ‘Magui Building' was constructed in 1951, a time of urban occupation in the neighborhood and a period of great significance to the development of the Modern Movement in Rio de Janeiro's urban architecture. It was during that same period and in those vicinities that great works were produced, including the Antônio Ceppas buildings (1952) by Jorge Machado Moreira and the Lagoa Hospital (former Sul América Hospital, 1952) by Oscar Niemeyer and Hélio Uchoa, with its landscape designed by Burle Marx.

Although the building's original design does not strictly follow Le Corbusier's urban precepts, it presents a geometric composition that is very much in line with the modern architecture produced at the time. This new intervention is based on the idea of inserting new elements with similar geometric characteristics as the existing ones. Because the new volume is withdrawn 5 meters from the building's main façade, the frontal view of the building has been unaffected. As  for  the  sides of  the building,  the new project was designed to follow the lines of the original composition.

Text description provided by the architects. The Westside project, a new center for leisure and shopping in Bern-Brünnen, is an urban scale architecture project totaling 1.5 million sq. ft. In addition to the 55 shops, 10 restaurants and bars, hotel, multiplex cinema, fun bath with wellness center and housing, this mixed-use program radically reinvents the concept of shopping, entertainment and living. Since opening in October 2008, Westside has welcomed a record number of visitors - 1.5 million in the first three months - and currently sees about 15,000-25,000 visitors per day. The Westside project is a joint venture between ADL and Burckhardt & Partner, Bern with Rhomberg Bau AG/Strabag AG and was completed in October 2008. Westside is one of a kind - a complex mixture of retail, residential and recreational facilities - an urban marketplace full of experiences that attracts visitors of all ages, interests and backgrounds. With its impressive location above the A1 highway, its direct connection to the tram and the BERNMOBIL transport network, Westside is a meeting place for the whole greater region of Bern. The development creates an exciting gateway into the city of Bern as it dramatically positions itself over the major highway and is integrated into the city with its own highway exit and train stop.

The Westside project creates a unique integration of architecture and landscape on a large, urban scale. The several-layer wooden facade connects the city area with the countryside, while emphasizing Westside as a major destination. Right-angled and transverse cut boxes constructed from steal concrete with a prop grid of 8,10 x 8,10 meters create sophisticated rooms and generate different external areas at Westside.

The concept of Westside was to create a public space with day and night facilities, a self-enclosed district offering endless amenities and services, almost like a city within a city. Westside is not only a landmark, but an urban organism which attracts the surrounding region, becoming a place of excursions, meetings and seminars, and leisurely activities. This mixed-use complex has all the conveniences and services of an independent town, yet at the same time is integrated into the city of Bern due to its location and convenient access to all modes of public transportation.

The mall is the spine of the public space, offering an array of shops and restaurants. Stores such as Swarovski, Esprit, H&M, L'Occitane en Provence, Wolford and Kinderland can be found at the Westside mall. The design includes lower and higher rooms, alleys and two plazas where the changing of daylight can be noticed through roof cuts. The two plazas each have individual identities. One plaza, reflecting the day, is oriented toward the landscape and opens up at the other end to the bath. The other plaza, reflecting the night, connects to the cinema and the hotel while providing atmosphere for night life and catering.

The building design integrates the landscape and the different directions of the site while providing a unique look to the external areas. Extensive window cuts in varying designs open up the facade. This has the effect of creating either a panoramic window for the food court and wellness area or a web of natural light for the circulation area. Furthermore, the views allow you to see the highway, gateway to the living area, the railway tracks and the widespread landscape to the south. This is a unique outside element of Westside Bern-Brünnen. During the day the partly dark tanned window cuts contrast with the light wood facade. At night they are illuminated so that the parts of the structure disappear in the darkness, similar to a picture puzzle, so that from the outside the cuts are recognized as lines.

The cubes forming Westside create openings to the many plazas as well as the bath. They are defined by crystalline form with angular sides which look like pieces of rock breaking through cube. The steel concrete construction is designed like a trapezoidal crystal where the structure creates openings, galleries and arcades, complete with shops and catering facilities. The interior is almost entirely plastered white. The grid structure of the crystal is covered with zinc plates at the points where it cuts the facade and the roof. Overall, the crystals and its plazas are designed like boxes; only the design of the glassine crystal of the bath is differing. The pattern of the mall’s alleys is never the same and it is not enclosed. Tentacled cuts create the spaces of the Mall at the facade and enhance the entrances and exits. The northern part of the mall leads to the forecourt of the train station, the senior residency, the hotel and the landscape.

Text description provided by the architects. Located in East Hampton, New York and situated on a narrow property atop a bluff overlooking Gardiner’s Bay, Lion's Head replaces a vacation home shared by two brothers and their families for over 25 years before it was destroyed by fire.  Since originally building on the site, new regulations have been established and the families have grown in size. The new structure responds to these needs while preserving and enhancing the casual summertime lifestyle long enjoyed by its owners.  More photographs and drawings of Lion's Head by Bates Masi Architects following the break.

The house is composed of two simple taut volumes clad in durable slate tiles and a weathering wood with naturally water-resistant tannins and oils. The public and private living areas are in the waterside volume, all with spectacular views and access to the beach.

Circulation, baths, and utilities are in the landward volume overlooking the pool.  By offsetting the volumes vertically and horizontally, the surface area of the compact design increases, allowing for more windows to admit light and westerly breezes.  This slippage also creates intimate outdoor spaces for bathing, entertaining, and dining.

Each volume is a deep frame, providing privacy from neighboring properties and leaving the east and west facades transparent for unobstructed views and seamless transitions between inside and outside. The frames are opened-up at their ends to create spaces that defy the conventional distinctions between indoors and outdoors.  At the roof deck, portions of the ceiling and upper walls are omitted to create an “outdoor room” open to the sky and the view, yet more contiguous with the interior than a conventional deck or terrace.  The screened porch is similarly opened to the elements while remaining integrated with the sequence of interior rooms.   The frames direct attention away from the house to the water views and surrounding landscape, further easing the boundaries between interior and exterior spaces.  By carefully intertwining spaces and materials with the landscape, the design creates an environment that the family will continue to enjoy for many years to come.

At the roof deck, portions of the ceiling and upper walls are omitted to create an “outdoor room” open to the sky and the view, yet more contiguous with the interior than a conventional deck or terrace.  The screened porch is similarly opened to the elements while remaining integrated with the sequence of interior rooms.   The frames direct attention away from the house to the water views and surrounding landscape, further easing the boundaries between interior and exterior spaces.  By carefully intertwining spaces and materials with the landscape, the design creates an environment that the family will continue to enjoy for many years to come.Each volume is a deep frame, providing privacy from neighboring properties and leaving the east and west facades transparent for unobstructed views and seamless transitions between inside and outside.

The growth in aviation at the end of World War II led to the proposal and passing of the Washington Airport Act of 1950, which stated that there would be federal backing for a second airport. After many proposed sites were not passed, President Eisenhower chose a small town once known as Willard as the best location for the airport in 1958.

Located 26 miles west of the central business district of Washington D.C. in Chantilly, Virginia, the Washington Dulles International Airport is named after John Foster Dulles, who was Secretary of State under President Eisenhower. It occupies 11,830 acres of land right on the border of Fairfax County and Loudoun County. Ranked the fifth largest hub for United Airlines, the Dulles Airport is one of the nation's busiest airports as it handles over 23 million passengers a day, flying to more than 125 destinations.

Finnish architect Eero Saarinen was hired as the architect of the main terminal, working with the civil engineering firm Ammann and Whitney, who was the lead contractor. Saarinen was chosen for his ability to provide graceful beauty, similar to the nature of flight. When faced with the challenge of designing the terminal's entrance, he had to create an articulated entrance to stand out against the modern and repetitive structure. He also had the typical challenge of providing graceful access to the building, encountered by automobile, entered and further accessed by foot. Famous architect Kevin Roche worked in the office of Saarinen during the time of this project, and with his contribution came the overal elliptical form of the building.

The Dulles terminal has two floors; the first for departing passengers, ticketing and concessions, and the other for arriving passengers, baggage claim, and ground transportation. One of the key moments of innovation in this terminal was the employment of new transport vehicles known as mobile lounges, which resembled a sort of giant luxury bus and carried  up to ninety people from the terminal to their plane.

From the ramp, departing passengers go through ticketing to the runway side where they would find gates to take them to the mobile lounge. This inclusion of the mobile lounge led to a revolutionary approach to airport movement, allowing the design of Dulles to do away with the multitude of gates that cluttered most terminals before it. In attempts to allow more space between the front of the building and the ticket counters, the main terminal was reconfigured and additions were made to both ends, doubling the structure's length.

The original terminal at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in Taipei, Taiwan was modeled after the Saarinen terminal at Dulles. This airport has been featured in many movies based in Washington, beginning with the 1964 film Seven Days in May. Other movies include Die Hard 2: Die Harder, The Package, Airport, Forces of Nature, The X-Files, and Body of Lies.

The building is a high performing design with sustainability at the core of the client brief. The envelope is a super-insulated steel stud frame with lightweight partitions and thermally massive floors. The spaces are naturally ventilated throughout and designed for natural light to all spaces. What heating the building needs is provided by a Combined Heat and Power plant unit that also produces electricity to be used for the building and the wider School.

- The volume of the building arises from the respect for the authorized size. Three public floors are concentrated between the 100-year flood level (for ground floor) and the 8m above ground level required by the fire regulation for a building with non-enclosed staircases (for higher public floor). Structure is optimized to offer a 2,20m ceiling height on each floor to ensure accessibility for all.

- Each floor corresponds to a particular function: a bar on the ground floor, sushi’s conveyors on 1st and 2nd floor, a teppanyaki at attic level. A panoramic elevator takes place on the thinner part of the plot, it forms sign in the daytime and at night, and is accessible from street level. This entrance provides access to the entire restaurant.

Text description provided by the architects. This residence is located on a northwesterly oriented beach fronting the Strait of Georgia. The site includes many second-growth douglas firs, a beech grove and a grassy meadow with good solar exposure. For over a thousand years this site was a summer camp location for the Lummi Indians, and due to its archeological significance, no footing excavation could take place on the site. Further, its location in a federally designated flood plain required that the structure be raised off the ground several feet. The design brief called for a very low-impact, easy to maintain summer home that provides necessary programmatic functions with minimum distractions from the land and the view.

Heliotrope Architects received a Merit Award - 2009 AIA Honor Awards for Washington Architecture for their design of North Beach.  Follow the break for more photographs and drawings of this project. The design response situates the structure among the trees directly between the beach and the meadow, with walls of glass opening out to both.  While actual shelter is provided, the experience is of nearly complete openness to the environment, with a minimized structure meant to disappear from view.

Steel tube columns minimize visible structure from the interior, while wood shear-wall elements provide a bold form when seen from the exterior.  A matt-slab was utilized to avoid excavation, and the foundation recessed to minimize the footprint.

The roof is vegetated, which filters rainwater that in turn is collected and stored for use in irrigating the garden and flushing toilets.  Potable hot water and hydronic heating are aided by 90 evacuated tube collectors on the roof, and a 4kW PV panel system above the vegetable garden provides supplemental electricity.  The home is intended for occupancy from May through October, and systems have been designed to zero out electricity use over the course of a full year.

The design team worked together to meet incredible scheduling and budget parameters. A parking variance and an intergovernmental agreement with the schools to the south saved the large ball field. The explicit intent of the design was to be environmentally responsible, and for the Public Park and its environs to remain the “green” heart of Maryvale. The design team’s ability to deal with the existing park-like conditions and provide a unique building solution for this site and the City’s goals demonstrates the design team’s dedication to finding unique solutions for the circumstances of a given site.

This project’s challenges included the need to maintain the existing recreational park, while reinvigorating the area and establishing a renewed civic presence in the community.  By designing a building comprised of metal clad blocks that rest on an 8-foot high band of glass, a transparency was created that allows people passing by to interact with the activity inside. The southeast corner of the park is preserved, and is thus transformed into a contemplative park for the library, as well as an unobstructed window into the site. The solid, upper portion of the street volumes are clad in mill-finish stainless steel. This requires 40% less energy to fabricate than ‘finished’ stainless steel and has a unique quality that absorbs light and color more than it reflects them. This quality allows the park to appear as if it figuratively moves through the mass of the building. The building simultaneously reads as bold and quiet, there and not there, while recording the range of light - a true response to our unique Arizona climate.

The building simultaneously reads as bold and quiet, there and not there, while recording the range of light - a true response to our unique Arizona climate.This project’s challenges included the need to maintain the existing recreational park, while reinvigorating the area and establishing a renewed civic presence in the community.  By designing a building comprised of metal clad blocks that rest on an 8-foot high band of glass, a transparency was created that allows people passing by to interact with the activity inside. The southeast corner of the park is preserved, and is thus transformed into a contemplative park for the library, as well as an unobstructed window into the site. The solid, upper portion of the street volumes are clad in mill-finish stainless steel.

Back in 1993, professors Dennis K. Ruth and the late Samuel Mockbee created Auburn University’s design-build program with the intention of bringing architecture to some of Alabama’s poorest areas. Rural Studio quickly gained international attention as the students responded to the needs of the less fortunate with innovative and thoughtful designs. The students participating in the studio not only benefit from the hands-on experiences of physically constructing their ideas, but also from fulfilling our profession’s social responsibility by providing a person’s most basic need, shelter.Back in 1993, professors Dennis K.

During the 2008-2009 school year, the plan for Lions Park grew to include mobile concessions stands and skatepark projects designed by thesis students.  The community’s desire for a skatepark led to the application and reception of the largest Tony Hawk Foundation grant.

The ledges and rails are made of cor-ten plates welded into volumes that protrude from the concrete strips.

The concept of the operable opening came from several discussions about the novelty of buying food out of a “mouth”. Not only does the opening allow an unobstructed panoramic view of all four baseball fields it also obviates the need for additional security measures. Once the “mouth” is closed it provides a difficult-to-compromise shell. Mobility was also a concern in the park that has multiple users who also might want to sell concessions; therefore the stand is mounted on a trailer chassis that allows it to be docked at separate hubs of activity in the park.

The Longview Gallery in Washington DC invited David Jameson Architect to design an installation that investigates the relationship of art and architecture. The gallery space is housed next to the DC Convention Center in the shell of a 1930’s auto repair garage. Conceived as a spatial armature, Stalling Detritus, as the installation is called, creates a gallery within the gallery by weaving steel beam scraps through space that react to the topography of the concrete structure.The Longview Gallery in Washington DC invited David Jameson Architect to design an installation that investigates the relationship of art and architecture.

Text description provided by the architects. The LEED Equivalent South Park Library is a meeting place and focal point for the rich and diverse South Park neighborhood in Seattle. Johnston Architects incorporated the spirit of the community within their design through material choices, colors, and gathering areas such as the courtyard/front porch space for the neighborhood. Follow the break for a full project description, photographs, and drawings of the library.
Save this picture!
In 1998 Seattle passed a $196.4 million bond measure that would be used to build 13 new libraries, including a new main library, and renovate and expand another 14. The modest, largely Latino neighborhood of South Park was not on the list. The citizens of South Park had, in fact, been trying to get a library for 100 years, as evidenced by a 1906 petition found in the city archives. It seems the community was not to be denied again and with vigor and determination wrestled $2.7 million out of a special “Opportunity Fund” to finally build a library that was completed in the spring of 2006.
Save this picture!
The program followed the Seattle Public Library template for a 5,000 square foot branch library with the typical complement of stack space, study rooms, reading room/lounge area and staff support areas. South Park departs from the usual program with its generous ESL spaces and an oversized children’s area. The program for this size branch usually calls for a 750-square-foot meeting room but the community felt they had enough places to hold meetings and urged the design team to give that space back to the library, specifically a larger area for its youngest users. The result is a highly visible “lantern” on the most prominent corner of the building that is lively and inviting during the library’s hours of operation.
Save this picture!
The design intent was to create a town center for South Park. The neighborhood is on the rise after decades of decline as immigrant groups from Latin America, the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia as well as young people of all ethnic groups are moving into one of the last affordable places to live in Seattle. This rich mix informed the look, color and configuration of the building. Solid blocks clad in red stucco are arranged to create both interior and exterior courtyards. The entry courtyard’s paving pattern recalls the original meandering path of the nearby Duwamish River. The metaphorical river flows from a fountain and ends in an aspen grove planted in front of the library.

The sum of the South Park branch library is more than its parts. It serves as a point of pride for a sometimes struggling but often joyous and cohesive part of the city. It is a tribute to community activism and vision and the end of a 100 year quest.

The Miner’s Refuge has taken up the challenge of drawing upon and adapting those lessons of the industrial, rural vernacular to accommodate the needs of a modern lifestyle. The building massing is mindful and reminiscent of the history of mining in the valley. Its long linear circulation corridor leads from the entry along the entire length of the house giving access to the living and sleeping spaces.

Sustainability begins with building restraint. The owners of Miner’s Refuge came to the table with a smart and simple program that could satisfy their living needs in less than 1,900 sqf. The home, shared between two families, incorporates an open kitchen/living/dining area, two modest master suites and a small bunk room accommodating up to four guests. Renewable and environmentally responsible products were used where possible, the orientation and detailing of the building take solar gain into consideration and efficient mechanical systems combine to make Miners Refuge a project respectful of its environment.

Text description provided by the architects. With sweeping views of the Cascades, Lake Union and just blocks from the exciting and eclectic Fremont district, this project consists of seven private town homes with shared underground parking in a cornerstone location.  Sustainable building practices were employed throughout the design process and the project is seeking LEED Platinum certification status. Johnston Architects decided that in order to achieve the LEED rating for this project it was imperative to embed sustainable principles into the process from the get-go encompassing both the natural and urban environments while utilizing unique green practices.

The town homes are carefully arranged in a U-shape, which provides for a central garden courtyard/community open space. This orientation allows for good southern exposure, vital indoor/outdoor connections, and also provides access to and from the garage below. A screen wall blanketed in vegetation wraps the community yielding both visual and acoustic privacy, rarities in an urban environment. The project’s innovative design, resourceful features and simplistic beauty truly exemplify a design shaped for the culture of Seattle.

The project is designed with a major emphasis on water efficiency and storm water recycling. Rainwater is collected from the rooftop and courtyard areas and conveyed to a large cistern in the garage, where it is filtered and then re-used on an as-needed basis. This building is projected to save over 50% of the energy used in a standard Washington code-based building of the same size. The project is targeting a 50% reduction over IECC (International Energy Conservation Code) as well as potable water use reduction targeted at over 100,000 gallons per year for the project relative to a standard code-based construction. The project also includes the use of FSC certified wood and low-VOC emitting, non-toxic materials and finishes. Significant effort has been made to substantially reduce the use of products containing PVC and urea formaldehyde.

The upper floor spaces include sustainable wood floors, slatted wood ceiling trim elements in corridors and tiling in the bathroom to accentuate character. These design and material decisions reflect the understated yet refined palette for this project while allowing the unit owners to individualize their homes to their own tastes and styles.

Text description provided by the architects. With sweeping views of the Cascades, Lake Union and just blocks from the exciting and eclectic Fremont district, this project consists of seven private town homes with shared underground parking in a cornerstone location.  Sustainable building practices were employed throughout the design process and the project is seeking LEED Platinum certification status. Johnston Architects decided that in order to achieve the LEED rating for this project it was imperative to embed sustainable principles into the process from the get-go encompassing both the natural and urban environments while utilizing unique green practices.Text description provided by the architects.

Text description provided by the architects. As mountain guides, Scott Schell and Margaret Wheeler are used to the upper reaches of the Cascades. Their site in the foothills above Snoqualmie is not far from work. The 2,100 sqf house, designed by Johnston Architects and built by Tall Tree Construction, accommodates both professional and practical demands, but it also fulfills a deep desire to do what is right.

This house was built on site with many materials found, milled and crafted on the site. Blow-down trees from storms provided the logs that were milled into siding, fascias and trim. Large firs and cedars were felled, cured and processed to provide beams and some framing materials. A ground source heat pump supplemented by solar water preheating supplies energy to the house. To this, recycled materials, FSC certified materials, grey water recycling and other strategies are the basis of the soon to be achieved LEED Silver status of this house.

The historic fabric of this complex lies in the history of use of the land and indoor/outdoor occupation of forested space. The mud room, nearby wood storage, use of varied floor materials to shake off the debris of the outside, simple roof forms are all part of this solution. Rather than dig the house into its hillside, we bridged across for an upper floor entry, minimizing grading and other disruption to the existing environment. Two thousand native plantings were made to restore the forest floor upon completion. Even on a grey and rainy day this forest retreat is filled with light.

Every year, over 2,000 people go on a 100 km pilgrimage path near Guadalajara, Mexico during Holy Week. Municipalities along the route decided to give the pilgrims some service areas along this route, so the Secreaty of Turism of Jalisco comissioned these projects to a group of both mexican and international architects: Ai Wei Wei (FAKE Design), Luis Aldrete, Christ & Gantenbein, Dellekamp Arquitectos (featured on AD), Elemental (featured on AD), Godoylab, HHF, Periférica and Tatiana Bilbao mxa.

Text description provided by the architects. Widely recognized for his emphasis on color, light, shadow, form and texture, it can only be expected that the former residence of Pritzker Prize winner Luis Barragan encompasses all of his trademarks. On its street in Mexico City, the stark facade of the house humbly blends in with its neighbors, giving no hints to the personality of it's interior.

The most prominent aspects of the design of Casa Barragan are the use of flat planes and light, both natural and artificial. The skylights and windows allow for visual tracking of light throughout the day; the floods of natural light and views of nature are the key purposes of the windows. Opening up into the garden, the back of the house creates a visible and physical relationship between the lower level and the backyard. Barragan often called himself a landscape architect because he placed as much emphasis on the exterior and surroundings of a building as he did on the interior.

Upon entering, the visitor walks down a dark hallway until they suddenly encounter a pink wall, the first engagement with the known style of Barragan. The only function of this main room is to use the telephone, but it is still characteristically lit and decorated with simply a chair and a table, neither of which have changed location in the last 50 years. The double height space of the main room is separated only by lower partition walls, which separate the space into different areas. On the roof, a window is accentuated by the use of wooden girders.

The play of privacy and visibility are seen throughout the front and back halves of the house. Towards the front, high windows are used to let light in but maintain privacy, whereas large windows open up the back to the garden. Since the back of the house opens up to private space as opposed to the public street at the front of the house, Barragan is able to manipulate the windows accordingly.

Barragan had a fascination with animals, particularly horses, so many relics of popular culture and symbols are found throughout the house. Crosses can also be found in multiple rooms, which, coupled with the bold colors used by Barragan, create a mythical and spiritual architecture. He found many of his furnishings at craft markets and antique shops, all true to the cultural identity of Mexico. This cultural flare is also apparent in the bold pink, yellow and lilac colors chosen by the architect. The minimalist style gives reason to the significance of detail, every aspect of the house has it's purpose and is obviously planned by the architect.

The purist of stairs lead visitors through the other stories of the house, towards private bedroom and studio spaces. The colors and simplistic designs are carried out throughout each level, even out onto the terraces and roof. Barragan discovers a poetry in architecture, straying from the standard and conventional line and creating a unique style that distinguishes who he is as a person and architect. He fuses his personal experiences, dreams and memories into a physical experience that is shared throughout cultures and ages.

The interior space of the building is designed as a dynamic sequence of stairs and split, open floor levels where abstract, white boxes hang freely from the ceiling filtering the light coming in through the high skylights.

Surface Deposit is an exhibition of fragmented sculptural assemblages based on the analysis and research of digital data collected by a 3-dimensional laser over several months during the summer of 2010. Incorporating various materials, including remnants from Tyler School of Art’s former campus in Elkins Park, PA, Lead Pencil Studio will explore notions of accumulation through elements of architecture that are not inherent to a structure’s original design. Their practice is self-described as “architecture in reverse…our projects are everything about architecture with none of its function…spaces with no greater purpose than to be perceived and question the certainty posited by the man-made world.”Surface Deposit is an exhibition of fragmented sculptural assemblages based on the analysis and research of digital data collected by a 3-dimensional laser over several months during the summer of 2010.

The input of the isotropic space of the board of the masterplan is accepted with the resulting a regular grid on plan and elevation on which some little ‘perturbations’ are introduced: they can generate a place where people understands and appreciates the complexity of contemporary life as intentional and aesthetic experience.

Text description provided by the architects. Arguably one of the most spatially innovative architects in the world, Rem Koolhaas, and his firm OMA, designed a cultural staple in the city of Rotterdam. Completed in 1992, the Kunsthal, in the Museumpark neighborhood of Rotterdam, is more of a cultural center that it is a museum. Dubbed as a collection-less museum, the Kunsthal is a compilation of several galleries and halls that allow for maximum flexibility and accommodate a multitude of exhibitions and activities that can coexist singularly or collectively.
Save this picture!
Situated along Maasboulevard, an expressway on top of one of Rotterdam’s largest dikes, the 3,300 square meter museum serves as a bridge between the busy expressway and the museum park to the north. The museum sits as a subdivided volume of four autonomous parts that are created by two intersections that are extensions of the surround city. 
Save this picture!
The first intersection is a road that runs east/west across the site, while the other is a wide pedestrian ramp that slopes down from the southern end of the site to the northern part, which provides a gentile transition between the elevated dike and the lower level park behind the museum.
Save this picture!
These intersections reinforce the conceptual framework for the spaces throughout the building, as being separate, yet unified. The intersections also express the museums design as a volumetric study rather than a planometric or sectional design strategy. 
Save this picture!
The volumetric design creates more of a compositional effect that is read as almost a kit of parts or a series of spaces becoming one cohesive system through the spatial juxtapositions and orientation of each space.  This spatial unification through separation heightens the dynamic qualities of each gallery and hall.

Even though, the volumes are divided and autonomous, Koolhaas was able to create a continuous spiraling circuit that connects the spaces through a series of ramps and interchanges that happen both above and below ground.

plan 02
The spiraling circuit is created by the interstitial space that mends the different experiences of each space.  Each moment of interchange transitions from one space to another as one fluid system, which is siginificant especially since the museum is understood to be collection-less and at any point in time the museum can be showing old art, new art, architecture exhibitions, sculpture, or photography displays.

These intersections are not only modes of circulation through the site, nor are they just conceptual urban flows that subdivide the larger volume of the building, rather they provide new spatial conditions for programmatic placement, visual connections, and entry.  One example of this would be the main entrance to the Kunsthal museum where the pedestrian ramp that runs north/south through the site meets the sloping ramp of the auditorium.
Save this picture!
As the two ramps meet at the lowest central point a new point of entry is established. Also, as the slope of the ramp for the auditorium seating begins to separate from the circulation ramp that runs parallel to the auditorium seating one can see into the restaurant that is placed underneath the auditoriums sloping surface.  The Kunsthal is a series of spatial conditions and juxtapositions that even though programmatically different and separate begin to reveal themselves to one another to create a seemingly unified system.

As the spaces are inherently different, so is the structural system of each of the volumes that make up the Kunsthal. In collaboration with Cecil Balmond, the structure of the Kunsthal  is just as dynamic as the spaces that it supports, but at the same time the Kunsthal is composed of structural devices that Balmond differentiates as structure and architectural intent.

As with most projects there are columns, beams, maybe some tension/compression cables, and lateral bracing, however, there are moments where structure appears where common perception and traditional rationalism would state otherwise. The structure of the Kunsthal is not a means to an end, but as a way to enrich the spatial dynamism of the galleries and halls.
Save this picture!
In one of the galleries on the east side of the building, there is a series of red tubes that weave in between the roof trusses and connect to create a semi-circular lattice. Most visitors think that it is a sculpture that’s integrated into the structure, but it is Cecil Balmond’s take on a non-linear lateral bracing system that has intent to add to the spatial efficacy of the gallery rather than a system that acts passively and is unseen.

"The detailing in the Kunsthal is a mode of detailing that frees the attention for other aspects such as the way the ground is read, the sensing of abstractions, of transparency and translucency, of concrete and of the conditions themselves. The sensing of a whole instead of all that fixation on the joins and the encounters."  - Rem Koolhaas

Text description provided by the architects. The challenge for Katsutoshi Sasaki was to create a place of residence in a neighborhood of Gifu, Japan that was claustrophobic and allowed little access to natural light and privacy.  The resulting project, called HARBOR, is a residence that challenges the crowded residential area and secures access of light and air for its residents while also providing access to the nature.

The concept for this project called for first envisioning the property as a full volume that met the requirements of the requested area size.   Following this assessment, area above and below the volume were proceeded to be cut away to reveal voids in the volume of the structure.

These voids, which increased the surface area and created a faceted facade to the street also became the place where the concept takes full form.  The void is where nature and architecture meet.  These mixed space areas, which are essentially inner courtyards, windows and common walkways, provide a source of light, air, and nature to be further integrated into the residential life of the inhabitants.

Residential units face the inside of each of the courtyards that they surround, with 2-3 bedrooms each.  This shared space among the units allows light and air to enter the essential living areas of the apartments and also provides an added level of interaction among the residents in each unit.   Katsutoshi Sasaki was able to develop a design that provided a sense of nature among the living spaces in an otherwise crowded and claustrophobic residential area.

River running in the valley of the Plaine near the town center Next to the various buildings, the shape of the frame is based on the lean-to and utilitarian buildings in the vicinity. The roof inclination of the Sports Center is the same as the nearby petanque club’s forming a harmonious whole.

The roofing is of an average height of 4,5 meter. It is supported by a white lacquered steel frame covered with thin strips glued together. A large wooden cantilever portico is maintained by small metallic poles on the other three sides. A waterproof layer made of steel tanks on the roof and of polycarbonate and larch sheets over the entire upper part of the building. The façade is covered with wooden lath to shield it from wind and sun. The lower part of the structure is in corten steel sheets over a steel frame closing the building.

The equipment can be moved around from a room to the open space based on needs and seasons. When it is cold the building is shut when there are large events or in warm periods, 9 front panels are opened so as to allow free circulation and open view on the scenery. This open space configuration makes it easy to see the river and to open up indoor activities outside. The doors are opened and kept open by gas spring struts and secured with a stainless steel cable. A large sliding door is the final part of the existing building that allows a wide opening of the building on the outside during events.

The Casa das Historias Paula Rego was designed by the architect Eduardo Souto de Moura. The building makes use of certain aspects of the region's historical architecture, which is here reinterpreted in a contemporary way. It can be immediately recognised thanks to its two pyramid-shaped towers and the red-coloured concrete used in its construction.

The building itself is subdivided into rooms which lead into one another and are laid out around the higher central room which houses the temporary exhibition. The building's interior has 750m2 of exhibition space, on top of the technical and service areas, and is decorated in neutral shades and paved with the blue-grey marble of Cascais. The building also houses a shop, a café which opens onto a verdant garden and an auditorium with 200 seats.

It is, however, an uncritical regionalism, that avoids the sense of ‘resistante' which lay behind other attempts at the approach in Portugal in the 1980s. In this museum created for Cascais, Souto de Moura associates certain formal devices with a legacy of architectural composition, adopting specific formulas for the building's insertion in the surrounding area as well as a use of scale which can be easily contextualised in a very specific type of geography. Its close proximity to the work of Raul Lino is therefore set in a “Southern” landscape, without resorting to any unnecessary decorative or picturesque frills.” “With the Casa das Historias, it can be said that Eduardo Souto de Moura has adopted and almost ‘regionalist' approach, distancing himself from the modem abstractionism that has been a dominant feature of his work.

It is therefore not surprising, if one continues the “analogy", that, when describing this museum, Souto de Moura also mentioned the pronounced roofs of Raul Lino's palaces, or the idea of an “inhabited chimney", evoking that of the kitchen in the monastery of Alcobaca_ In fact, in its best interpretation, the Casa das Historias can be seen as a “historicist" project, a condition that will certainly surprise Souto de Moura's most faithful followers and confound his harshest critics."“With this museum, Souto de Moura develops a form of “modern-day architecture” without, in fact, repeating any of the “old models" - in keeping with the ideas defended by Aldo Rossi in his scientific autobiography - evoking timeless archetypes from urban iconography: towers, lighthouses, silos and chimneys, like the ones that define the profile of the Palacio de Sintra.

More images and architect’s description after the break.The project: The project:The objective is to create an urban space as a social bond in a dense cultural program. This fragment gap divides the building into two units by means of a horizontal fracture that opens the view on the Los Caobos Park and incorporates the notion of landscape to the project. It is a meeting place for visitors and users. This space connects the music conservatory, a compact block anchored to the ground, and the concert hall, a light block suspended as a precious levitated object over the park. The silhouette takes the poetic symbolism of the tree: the musical knowledge starts at the root of the project and the creative genesis arises at the top through the artistic talent of musicians The objective is to create an urban space as a social bond in a dense cultural program.

In the basement (-22.50.00 to -12.60), three levels of parking are reserved for users of the complex different programs. The pedestrian entrance to CIASMSB is common for users and visitors, to better monitor the safety of the building. The project is organized at the atrium (00.00) around a central core of distribution. Viewers have access to concert halls escalators through the central axis of the building; musicians access to the conservatory through the children pole on one side and the juvenile pole on the other side. At the lower level (-12.60 to 5.65), four stages are used to distribute the music conservatory, with links between the different poles of education. The intermediate zone (5.65 to 15.60) is a vast place, a place of confluence of young artists with the public. It includes restaurants, public spaces, residency area, improvised concert scenes and stands. At the top level (15.60 to 38.00), three levels are used to distribute the concert halls, as well as the foyers, located north for the musicians with a view of the Avila Mountain, and south for visitors with a view to Los Caobos Park. The roof is a technical level, including a single stage design grill for the common management of both concert halls. The overall organization of the project is by horizontal layers.

Closeness between audience and musicians is part of the CIASMSB project idea. For this reason, the shape of the halls is a hybrid between the “Shoebox” and “Vineyard”, where good visibility and the finest acoustics are obtained. The shapes of the rooms have been especially designed to build in a style unique to the Venezuelan artisanal creations.The three concert halls (1700 -1300 – 500 seats) are treated differently to obtain multiple acoustics and to respond to the specificity of different orchestras. The large concert hall of 1700 seats has an international vocation, it can respond to a program with numerous modular spaces in special events. The concert hall of 1300 seats favors singers and sets the scene in the heart of the room. The seats of the choir can be attributed to the spectators.

Text description provided by the architects. Kirkenes is a city of 6000 inhabitants (ca. 9500 in the larger area) in North East Norway next to Russia. Far enough from the political and economical centers, such as capitals, bigger cities, giant business headquarter and cultural institutions, this Barents city has created its own way of international and dynamic interactivity on a grass root level in necessary everyday survival activity like fishing, constructing and tourism. Here meet the Sami, Russian, Norwegian and Finnish Kven human endeavor, divided only, unnecessarily enough, by artificial boundaries.

The passing-by sailors, fishers, hunters, backpackers and fortune-seekers need a place to stay that suits their ever-changing economy; a small hotel without any futile luxury but a roof over head, warm fireplace and a view to the Barents Sea, straight from the bed of reindeer skins.

The hotel has a single room, a double room and a lobby. The key is to be received from Via Travels agency or the local Tourist Office.

The project was constructed in ten days with an economic budget. It is a totally wooden structure standing on a lightweight brick fundament. Whole interior is painted natural white for maximum light condition during winter, exterior brown black to receive sun warmth and to imitate the color of the rocky seashore. The house is anchored to the pier rocks to match with the rough weather conditions prevailing at the site. A large letter H  is painted on the wall facing the city, to facilitate the reading of a hotel in the landscape of warehouses and containers.

The work is based on a simple offering, it is a shelter where amount of ideas and economy of means try to balance.

Text description provided by the architects. The 20m x 30m plot of land in the coastal Mar Azul forest in Buenos Aires, Argentina is the site for BAK Architects' JD House, a residence designed in concrete, wood and glass and blended into the topography and vegetation on the site.  The preliminary specifications for the house required two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a large, flexible social area, integrated into the kitchen, that could accommodate different activities for the guests that are expected to visit.  The client also specified that generous outdoor expansions were available on the site.

The land on which the house is situated follows a gentle slope that provided a welcome challenge for the design of the house.   In relationship to the street level, the house sits very high above the ground in order to adjust to the level changes on the site.  This provides a a heightened condition of privacy, as passersby are less able to see into the house from the street, and a vantage point from which the inhabitants can view out onto the landscape over neighboring houses.

The house was conceived as two pure prisms, located in a clearing among trees of various heights, as intersecting perpendicular forms that joined at half levels.  The slope was once again used to the advantage of the proposal to hide parts of the program, thereby reducing the presence of the building on the site.  The form that developed from the conjoining of the volumes resulted in programs that were substantially independent from one another, but united through large openings in the social gathering spaces as well as through outdoor terraces and wooden decks that extended the living space out into the forest.

The house is accessed along the longest side through a deck that is raised above the natural terrain.  By stepping the deck into complete volume of the house and creating a corner as the entrance, BAK Architects simulated an interior condition in the exterior of the residence, where already the material and spatial organization is felt.  The height difference perceived in the entry intentionally signify the different uses of the spaces caused by the intersections of the prisms.

The architects play with the volumes, alternating between high and low ceilings and depressed floors to provide a dynamic space of a variety of functions.  The level of transparency through the house is equally as important as the opacity of the gray concrete walls.  The views through the house direct its users' eyes onto the landscape beyond the house, whereas the concrete walls direct light and provide organized views within the house.  While the house is visually open, the architects took great care to create private areas, such as bedrooms and bathrooms, that are nestled and buried under the general "ground level" of the house.  The architects were careful to leave as many salvageable trees on the site as possible allowing them to pierce through several of the outdoor decks that are an extension of the house.

The three basic materials of the house are exposed concrete, glass and wood, as well as the natural decorative elements of the surrounding forest.   H21 concrete was used with the addition of a plasticizer to the mix with little amounts of water used to harden, resulting in a very compact material that does not require sealing.  The few hollow brick interior walls are finished in smoothing cement. The heating system, since there is no natural gas in the area, was resolved with a system that combines salamander, bottled gas stoves and electric heaters.

Text description provided by the architects. The 20m x 30m plot of land in the coastal Mar Azul forest in Buenos Aires, Argentina is the site for BAK Architects' JD House, a residence designed in concrete, wood and glass and blended into the topography and vegetation on the site.  The preliminary specifications for the house required two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a large, flexible social area, integrated into the kitchen, that could accommodate different activities for the guests that are expected to visit.  The client also specified that generous outdoor expansions were available on the site.Text description provided by the architects.

The client also specified that generous outdoor expansions were available on the site.The land on which the house is situated follows a gentle slope that provided a welcome challenge for the design of the house.   In relationship to the street level, the house sits very high above the ground in order to adjust to the level changes on the site.  This provides a a heightened condition of privacy, as passersby are less able to see into the house from the street, and a vantage point from which the inhabitants can view out onto the landscape over neighboring houses.The land on which the house is situated follows a gentle slope that provided a welcome challenge for the design of the house.

Alexander Remizov, architect for Remistudio, shared with us his project, “The Ark”, which is designed as a bioclimatic building with independent life-support systems that can be built on land or sea. Remizov envisioned this project as the house for the future which can be constructed quickly and withstand environmental disasters through its structural integrity. More images and architect’s description after the break.Alexander Remizov, architect for Remistudio, shared with us his project, “The Ark”, which is designed as a bioclimatic building with independent life-support systems that can be built on land or sea. Remizov envisioned this project as the house for the future which can be constructed quickly and withstand environmental disasters through its structural integrity. More images and architect’s description after the break.For architecture, two aspects are of higher concern: the first one is maintenance of security and precautions against extreme environmental conditions and climate changes. The second one – protection of natural environment from human activities. The Ark project makes an attempt to answer these challenges of our Time. The Ark project was designed on the basis of international experience received from the UIA Work Program “Architecture for Disasters Relief” and according to the concept of a bioclimatic house with independent life support sources. In such buildings provision is made for an independent life support system including elements ensuring a closed functioning cycle.

In such buildings provision is made for an independent life support system including elements ensuring a closed functioning cycle.The structural solidity is provided by compression behavior of the timber arches and tension behavior of the steel ropes. The framework is covered by a special foil made of Ethyl TetraFluoroEthylene (ETFE). It is a strong highly transparent foil, self-cleaning, recyclable, more durable, more economical and lighter than glass. The foil itself is fixed to the framework by special metal profiles, which serve at the same time as solar collectors for water heating and as gutters intended for collecting rainwater from the roof surface. It’s a cupola building with a central bearing in a form of a tube with all engineering communications passing inside it. Such a form permits to attain an optimum relationship between the building’s volume and its outer surface, which gives a substantial saving of materials and produces effective energy usage. Prefabricated frame permits to erect such buildings quickly. The structural solidity is provided by compression behavior of the timber arches and tension behavior of the steel ropes.

The form of the cupola assists to create an air-eddy at the outer surface around the central bearing, where the wind power generator and tornado generator are placed. The form of the building is convenient for placing on it the photoelectric cells at a necessary angle to the Sun. The form of the cupola assists to agglomeration of the warmed air in the upper part. This heat is collected in seasonal heat accumulators, in electric and hydrogen accumulators, in order to provide an uninterrupted energy supply for the whole complex in spite of the outer environment conditions. The heat from surrounding environment – the outer air, water or ground – is also used. The building can produce extra power for supplying adjacent houses and “green” transport means.

A stressed structure of arches and ropes permits to distribute load along the whole bulk in case of earthquake. The structure of the building permits it to float in case of water leveling up in the World Ocean, to keep afloat and exist autonomously on the surface of the water. All the wastes are utilized inside the building by methods of explosion boiling up and oxygen-free pyrolysis.

All the plants are chosen according to principles of compatibility, illumination and efficiency of oxygen producing, as well as with the aim of creating an attractive and comfort space. The triple height illuminated space permits to create well-lit places at any time of day. Through the transparent roof there is enough light penetrating for plants and for illuminating the inner rooms. The balconies serve as a way of communication and a recreation place. The building has free lay-out and might easily be adapted to different functions as the time goes. Planting of greenery – that’s the next step in creating a bioclimatic building.

Text description provided by the architects. The urban landscape of São Paulo is heavily influenced by two main characters that coexist independently and simultaneously. On one hand, the vertical constructions – most of them faithful to the modernist/rationalist models –, which evolve randomly with the inconstant guidelines of the urban planning. On the other hand, the historical and/or informal occupation of two or three floors of the residual spaces between these constructions.

The ensemble is characterized by spectacular scale and height limits breaks, resulting in a chaotic and discontinuous urban landscape. Located in the heart of a middle class neighborhood undergoing constant change, the project – a standard housing tower – is precisely put in this context, and situated on the margins of one of these permanent breaks, revealing a split panoramic skyline.

This proposal is nourished by the formal and textual complexity of the site, and reformulates the traditional “paulista” residence model. The fragmentation of the building’s body into three parts is made for a better integration of the recreational area and the vertical / horizontal circulation spaces. A small square in the frontal area is given back to the urban space.

Text description provided by the architects. Located in the ancient commercial harbor of Rouen (France), the project focuses on the extension of an old storage hangar between the railroad tracks and the Seine River, allowing it to house an auditorium and exhibit spaces.
Save this picture!
In the middle of the building, a white lattice of lacquered steel surrounds an empty space occupied by a three-storey double staircase. This large mashrabiya captures and diffracts light coming from bay windows above and around it, radiating bursts of light and shadow. Such kinetic intensity gives the space a gentle monumentality. At night, the lattice becomes a lantern, emerging from the lowest floor beneath the hangar’s frame. 
Save this picture!
The auditorium sits partially beneath the old hangar, a concrete structure independent of the existing building frame. The space conveys a sense of appeasement, with white floors, walls, ceilings and furnishing… A muted ambiance that is completed by a carpet and acoustic textiles. The surprise lies at the end of the room, however, when the back wall of the stage opens, and the harbor is invited to join the conversation – to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the rotation of the vertical blinds.

It should be a place where all the three generations would feel comfortable. It should be a place that everyone will like, the space where they can communicate with each other. where one can play and have fun and the other one can just relax, watch others play and even join them The aim of the proposal is to create a universal place where all the three generations would feel comfortable. It should be a place where all the three generations would feel comfortable. It should be a place that everyone will like, the space where they can communicate with each other. where one can play and have fun and the other one can just relax, watch others play and even join themproject consists of three conceptual elements: “green hill”, “circular stair-bench” and “street lamp forest”. project consists of three conceptual elements: “green hill”, “circular stair-bench” and “street lamp forest”.Green hill – you can walk around it, climb over it, lie on a top, and just feel the nature. Nature is the place where everyone of every age feels comfortable, relaxed, healthy, joyful etc. This proposal offers everybody to get closer to the nature.

Random arrangement of posts imitates trees in the forest. Children can run between these metal trees trying to catch each other, young couples can lean against the post to give each other a kiss in a romantic evening under the soft lighting of the street lamp.

Clark Thenhaus, of Endemic Architecture has shared with Arch Daily his design for a gateway to the Indianapolis Art Center. While the project has been canceled, we felt the design was still worth sharing to our readers. Follow after the break for additional renderings, diagrams and a description from the architect. Historically, the concept of a gateway had much to do with one of three threshold typologies…the monumental, the iconic, or the natural. The Median Berms proposal for the Indianapolis Art Center exploit the existing site and infrastructural conditions to create a gateway with elements of the three historic gateway typologies. The monumental, the iconic, and the natural are hybridized through scale, geometry, and landscape creating over-scaled field sculptural berms.

The monumental, the iconic, and the natural are hybridized through scale, geometry, and landscape creating over-scaled field sculptural berms.The Median Berms grow from the existing highway medians and edges, areas most often left to the mercy of generic landscape decor. The Berms grow vertically as they slowly undulate and curl towards the museum as a subtle directional indication. Using the roadside medians and edges allows for needed site beautification, activation, and presence as part of the gateway strategy, creating an implied volume that you move through, rather then simply under. The frontal facing of The Berms are angled accordingly for appropriate sight lines for automobile traffic.

The scale and geometry of the berms add emphasis to the intersection upon approach and are at once monumental, iconic, and natural. By not covering any portion of the street, the berms create a softened edge as a gateway which one moves through as a space. The plantings of the berms are of native plants to the Indiana region. These include Big Blue Stem, Indian Grass, Butterfly Milkweed, Foxglove Beard Tongue, Northern Dropseed, and Shooting Star. The dynamic bloom cycles of the plantings create an ever changing array of color and texture throughout the seasons. Similarly the Big Blue Stem and Indian Grass are tall prairie grasses activated by breezes, creating a bustling, waving field of bluish amber, augmenting the geometry of The Berms.

Both the side walls and planting beds of the berms are constructed by using ruled surfaces. This means that each surface can be made from straight lines (structural members) between the two edges which give it shape, making them a feasible construction with a unique geometric quality. The walls are would be made of matte white fiberglass sheets over a structural envelope. The fiberglass shell would lend to a lighter feel and can be easily cleaned.

The combination of the modules offers a vast possibility of spatial configuration, thus can be used in different sites, in different heights and in different planer/sectional combinations for a variety of programs. While the diversity of the modules allows flexibility of use, the combination of these, still reflects a sense of unity, without compromising the structural system.

Text description provided by the architects. The design challenge was to create an affordable, iconic building symbolic of the Spanish painter’s work. The team ensured technical feasibility and design excellence while avoiding “kitsch.” The three-story museum is on a beautiful bayside site along St. Petersburg’s downtown waterfront. The dramatic envelope balances the exhibition and protection of the priceless masterpieces within a simple, powerful aesthetic. A “treasure box” shelters the 2,000-piece collection from potential Category 5 hurricane winds and storm surges.

The design opens up the 18-inch-thick concrete walls with a free-form glass geodesic structure that intrigues visitors while bringing daylight and bay views into public spaces. The 75-foot-tall geodesic glass “Enigma” and 45-foot-tall “Igloo” are formed by 1,062 undulating faceted glass panes, with no two exactly alike.

"We constantly consider the visitor experience when we design a museum. A large number of people visiting a museum will be there for the first time. The architecture must be extremely easy to understand. It can be quite adventurous and stimulating, but the circulation pathways should be clear from the moment visitors arrive at the building.

 "We deliberately exposed the unfinished faces of the concrete to reduce maintenance and to allow it to be a tough, natural foil to the more refined precision of the glass Enigma. This contrast between the rational world of the conscious and the more intuitive, surprising natural world is a constant theme in Dalí's work.

"The flowing, free-form use of geodesic triangulation is a recent innovation enabled by modern computer analysis and digitally controlled fabrication that allows each component to be unique. No glass panel, structural node or strut is precisely the same. This permitted us to create a family of shapes that, while structurally robust, more closely resembles the flow of liquids in nature." —Yann Wymouth, design director for HOK Florida.

Osprey Nest is the expression of a return to fundamentals, the exploration and subsequent interpretation of what an architect has learned.  For example, the basic courtyard house is more about "finding" the secret garden than a program surrounding an outdoor space. It is about the lure of reflected light from an unseen source as it beckons one to enter. It is the untouchable sky made tangible by the context of a parapets edge.  The arch is used in the home as a space beyond an outline, the sunlight finds its dance partner, the brick finds its vault and the view thanks its gentle frame.

The highest point of the beach house roof there is a ragged sculpture of glass and steel respecting the indigenous image of a vernacular construction.  This design decision was made to reflect the local bird life, the osprey.  Almost as large as an eagle, this majestic coastal bird builds its huge nest high in the local power poles. The nest is an architecture of scavenge material such as twigs, grass, string, rope, scraps of colorful fabric, strips of plastic all dangling randomly from the poles wooden cross members and sparkling glass insulators. The design also opted to leave the rebar exposed, as an obvious reference to local tradition as well as for the playfulness of the shadows.

Text description provided by the architects. As part of a competition to replace an older cemetery, Enric Miralles and Carme Pinos envisioned a new type of cemetery that began to consider those that were laid to rest, as well as the families that still remained. After 10 years of construction, the Igualada Cemetery, outside of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, was completed in 1994 as a place of reflection and memories.

The Igualada Cemetery is a project that challenges the traditional notions of what makes a cemetery.  Miralles and Pinos conceptualized the poetic ideas of a cemetery for the visitors to begin to understand and accept the cycle of life as a link between the past, present, and future. 
Save this picture!
It’s understood by the architects to be a “city of the dead” where the dead and the living are brought closer together in spirit.  As much as the Igualada Cemetery is a place for those to be laid to rest, it is a place for those to come and reflect in the solitude and serenity of the Catalonian landscape.

Embedded in the Catalonian hills, the Igualada Cemetery is an earthwork that blends into the landscape as if it were a natural aspect of the land. The cemetery was designed as a tiered landscape that unfolds into the landscape as one continuous and fluid progression.

The main burial area is part of a lowered excavated part of the cemetery that is surrounded by gabion walls and the mausoleum-like burial plots, which obstructs the visitor’s vision from the surrounding context secluding them in an area where the sky is the only visible entity outside of the central burial area.  Unlike the first tier, the second tier of the cemetery has more traditional burial plots that are separated and spread out rather than the mausoleum-like burial plots below.

Also, on the second level, there is a chapel and monastery that remain unfinished; however, the unfinished aspects are not lacking, by any means, spatially rather they are void of definition and detail.  Yet, the lack of information and detailing compliments the overall sensations of the project where the spaces are open and void to retain the experiences of solitude and serenity.

As one enters the site, one confronts a set of cor-ten steel poles that double as gates to the cemetery – the poles are likened to the crosses at Calvary.  From the main entrance, there is a processional winding pathway that descends into the main burial area; the pathway is lined with concrete “loculi” - mausoleum burial plots – that wrap around the depressed space as a transition from tier to tier.  
Save this picture!
The windy path is conceptualized as the river of life that moves from a wide open expanse in the Catalonian hills to a secluded memorial space excavated below the horizon.  The circulation through the cemetery adheres to a more processional effect that focuses less on the organization of the burial plots, but rather the experience.

The materials of the Igualada cemetery tie the project seamlessly back into the landscape.  Miralles employed earthy materials of concrete, stone, and wood into the project.  The gabion walls, the worn/aged concrete, and the wooden railroad ties embedded in the stone groundscape evoke the hard and rough landscape of the surrounding hills.  The earthy tones of the materials transform the architecture into a natural aesthetic creating the appearance that cemetery has long been part of the site.

The Igualada Cemetery is in a sense an organic architecture that integrates into the natural landscape as an extension of the Catalonian hills.  It is just as much a part of the landscape as the people that visit it. Even Miralles after his sudden death in 2000 is buried at the Igualada Cemetery, which in a sense completes the cycle of Miralles life: past, present, and future all clinging onto the Igualada Cemetery.

After 10 years of construction, the Igualada Cemetery, outside of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, was completed in 1994 as a place of reflection and memories.The Igualada Cemetery is a project that challenges the traditional notions of what makes a cemetery.  Miralles and Pinos conceptualized the poetic ideas of a cemetery for the visitors to begin to understand and accept the cycle of life as a link between the past, present, and future. The Igualada Cemetery is a project that challenges the traditional notions of what makes a cemetery.  Miralles and Pinos conceptualized the poetic ideas of a cemetery for the visitors to begin to understand and accept the cycle of life as a link between the past, present, and future. It’s understood by the architects to be a “city of the dead” where the dead and the living are brought closer together in spirit.  As much as the Igualada Cemetery is a place for those to be laid to rest, it is a place for those to come and reflect in the solitude and serenity of the Catalonian landscape.It’s understood by the architects to be a “city of the dead” where the dead and the living are brought closer together in spirit.  As much as the Igualada Cemetery is a place for those to be laid to rest, it is a place for those to come and reflect in the solitude and serenity of the Catalonian landscape.Embedded in the Catalonian hills, the Igualada Cemetery is an earthwork that blends into the landscape as if it were a natural aspect of the land. The cemetery was designed as a tiered landscape that unfolds into the landscape as one continuous and fluid progression.Embedded in the Catalonian hills, the Igualada Cemetery is an earthwork that blends into the landscape as if it were a natural aspect of the land. The cemetery was designed as a tiered landscape that unfolds into the landscape as one continuous and fluid progression.The main burial area is part of a lowered excavated part of the cemetery that is surrounded by gabion walls and the mausoleum-like burial plots, which obstructs the visitor’s vision from the surrounding context secluding them in an area where the sky is the only visible entity outside of the central burial area.  Unlike the first tier, the second tier of the cemetery has more traditional burial plots that are separated and spread out rather than the mausoleum-like burial plots below. The main burial area is part of a lowered excavated part of the cemetery that is surrounded by gabion walls and the mausoleum-like burial plots, which obstructs the visitor’s vision from the surrounding context secluding them in an area where the sky is the only visible entity outside of the central burial area.  Unlike the first tier, the second tier of the cemetery has more traditional burial plots that are separated and spread out rather than the mausoleum-like burial plots below. Also, on the second level, there is a chapel and monastery that remain unfinished; however, the unfinished aspects are not lacking, by any means, spatially rather they are void of definition and detail.  Yet, the lack of information and detailing compliments the overall sensations of the project where the spaces are open and void to retain the experiences of solitude and serenity.Also, on the second level, there is a chapel and monastery that remain unfinished; however, the unfinished aspects are not lacking, by any means, spatially rather they are void of definition and detail.  Yet, the lack of information and detailing compliments the overall sensations of the project where the spaces are open and void to retain the experiences of solitude and serenity.As one enters the site, one confronts a set of cor-ten steel poles that double as gates to the cemetery – the poles are likened to the crosses at Calvary.  From the main entrance, there is a processional winding pathway that descends into the main burial area; the pathway is lined with concrete “loculi” - mausoleum burial plots – that wrap around the depressed space as a transition from tier to tier.  As one enters the site, one confronts a set of cor-ten steel poles that double as gates to the cemetery – the poles are likened to the crosses at Calvary.  From the main entrance, there is a processional winding pathway that descends into the main burial area; the pathway is lined with concrete “loculi” - mausoleum burial plots – that wrap around the depressed space as a transition from tier to tier.  The windy path is conceptualized as the river of life that moves from a wide open expanse in the Catalonian hills to a secluded memorial space excavated below the horizon.  The circulation through the cemetery adheres to a more processional effect that focuses less on the organization of the burial plots, but rather the experience.The windy path is conceptualized as the river of life that moves from a wide open expanse in the Catalonian hills to a secluded memorial space excavated below the horizon.  The circulation through the cemetery adheres to a more processional effect that focuses less on the organization of the burial plots, but rather the experience.The materials of the Igualada cemetery tie the project seamlessly back into the landscape.  Miralles employed earthy materials of concrete, stone, and wood into the project.  The gabion walls, the worn/aged concrete, and the wooden railroad ties embedded in the stone groundscape evoke the hard and rough landscape of the surrounding hills.  The earthy tones of the materials transform the architecture into a natural aesthetic creating the appearance that cemetery has long been part of the site.The materials of the Igualada cemetery tie the project seamlessly back into the landscape.  Miralles employed earthy materials of concrete, stone, and wood into the project.  The gabion walls, the worn/aged concrete, and the wooden railroad ties embedded in the stone groundscape evoke the hard and rough landscape of the surrounding hills.  The earthy tones of the materials transform the architecture into a natural aesthetic creating the appearance that cemetery has long been part of the site.The Igualada Cemetery is in a sense an organic architecture that integrates into the natural landscape as an extension of the Catalonian hills.  It is just as much a part of the landscape as the people that visit it. Even Miralles after his sudden death in 2000 is buried at the Igualada Cemetery, which in a sense completes the cycle of Miralles life: past, present, and future all clinging onto the Igualada Cemetery.The Igualada Cemetery is in a sense an organic architecture that integrates into the natural landscape as an extension of the Catalonian hills.  It is just as much a part of the landscape as the people that visit it.

ArchDaily is pleased to present the first and second prize winners of the Atlantic City Boardwalk Holocaust Memorial Competition. The first prize was awarded to the proposal, “Fractured Landscapes” by Patrick Lausell and Paola Marquez, of Somerville, Mass. The second prize winner, SAYA, submitted a proposal entitled “Fields of Memory.” Both projects received high esteem from the judges. The jury included Daniel Libeskind, Richard Meier, Michael Berenbaum, Clifford Chanin, Wendy Evans Joseph, and James E. Young and selected from 712 proposals from 55 countries. More on both projects after the break.ArchDaily is pleased to present the first and second prize winners of the Atlantic City Boardwalk Holocaust Memorial Competition.

Young, one of the judges, described it as a reflection of something broken within all of us, “subtle and powerful at the same time, it takes you off the Boardwalk and leaves you on the Boardwalk.” The fruition of the concept into a built intervention in Atlantic City is still a way off. Although the project has won the competition, it will need to presented to other agencies and go through “evolutionary back-and-forth” between other architects, says Memorial Chairman Rabbi Gordon Geller.

The design is raised on a wooden deck above the level of the boardwalk and relates to the sea-grass situated between the boardwalk and the ocean. The concept of the light stalks derive from a biblical story of Shibboleth (Judges 12, 5-6) that has become a synonym for hatred based on an ethnic and cultural base. Its presence on the boardwalk as a memorial to the events it recognizes commemorates the loss of millions, and through their own collective nature emphasize this memory through eternal lights that they emit. “Fields of Memory” by Jerusalem-based architects SAYA, is an urban garden of light stalks that sway with the wind and emit soft flute-like sounds.

The reflection of those that will visit the memorial will always look out into the present activities of life on the boardwalk as a reminder of perseverance and that grief and memory are inseparable from life. A low reflecting pool at the center of the memorial also creates a focal point for gathering, holding ceremonies, and laying pebbles as an act of grief. It reflects the visitors during the day and the stalks during the night.SAYA’s design proposal recognizes the need to commemorate loss by binding it with the present by situating seating and gathering areas to face the boardwalk rather than the ocean.

Recently, we visited Thomas Phifer’s office in New York – a working floor that embodies the same spirit as his architecture with its pristine furnishings and axial organization.

Phifer (who is also an avid Arch Daily reader) began his firm back in the 1990s and, as his office has grown and developed, his projects have been honored with several AIA Honor Awards and American Architecture Awards.In fact, the firm’s North Carolina Museum of Art project is one of only ten projects to have been awarded a 2011 AIA Honor Award, the organization’s highest recognition for building design.  The AIA commented that the building’s interior’s “gently luminous setting,” the result of natural light that is filtered through hundreds of elliptical oculi in the ceiling, and the way in which its exterior, enclosed in matte aluminum panels, “continue the discourse with the landscape” and offers “unexpected and scintillating reflections.”  Since opening in April 2010, the project has dramatically transformed the visitor experience of both the Museum itself and the 164-acre park in which it is sited, and with which West Building is visually and experientially integrated. Surrounded by five courtyards, each of which seems to enter the structure, the museum is a strong example of Phifer’s desire to blend the natural with the artificial.

As a prominent twentieth century architect who fuses main principles of design from his peers and fellow architects with his own, Richard Meier is known for his endless variations of a rather specific theme of white Neo-Corbusian form, mostly using enameled panels and glass. The emphasis on light, color, place, plain geometry and the interaction between all of the latter help Richard Meier & Partners Architects to design architecture that is clear, comprehensible, and easily admirable.

Situated in a prestigious residential community on a one-and-a-half acre waterfront site, this house faces southwest over Doubloon Bay. One approaches the wedge-shaped site, which fans out towards the water, from a winding avenue lined with royal palm trees. In forecourt of the house a square grove of twenty-five palms serves as foil to a freestanding cylindrical garage faced in limestone.

Since the turfed area of the forecourt is reinforced, pedestrians and cars are free to circulate across the greensward at will. Beyond, concealing the water, lies the horizontal facade of the house itself, clad in two by three foot limestone slabs backed by a concrete frame and masonry structure. Pierced at regular intervals by vertical slot windows, the facade conceals a wide, top-lit access corridor running the length of the house.

The linear organization consists of five parallel layers from front to back: access, service, living, sun terrace, and lap pool. A raised main entry penetrates the limestone wall of the front facade to give onto the corridor. A fifteen-foot module controls the structural bay and the incremental dimensions of all the cellular spaces. The main volumes, including both sleeping and living spaces, are arranged in a linear formation, affording each room an impressive view over the lap pool to the bay beyond.

Text description provided by the architects. One of the most important architects of the 20th Century, yet often overlooked, Richard Neutra has been on the forefront of modern residential architecture.  After moving to the United States from Vienna, Austria in 1923, Neutra worked with Frank Lloyd Wright and Rudolf Schindler until 1930 when he started his own practice.

One of Neutra’s several iconic projects is the Kaufmann House in Palm Springs, California. Completed between 1946-1947, the Kaufmann House was a vacation home for Edgar J. Kaufmann Sr. and his family to escape the harsh winters of the northeast.

10 years after the design of Fallingwater by Frank Lloyd Wright in Bear Run, Pennsylvania, the Kaufmann’s were looking for a residence that could be used to escape the cold winters of the northeast, which would primarily be used during January.

After seeing Wright’s Taliesin West, Kaufmann was unimpressed and gave his commission to Richard Neutra.   Unlike Taliesin West, which implemented more earthy tones and materials, Neutra employed a more modernist and international style approach using glass, steel, and some stone in the design.

The design of the house is quite simplistic; at the center of the house is the living room and the dining room that is the heart of the house and the family activity. The rest of the house branches out like a pinwheel in each of the cardinal directions.  From the center of the house each wing that branches out has its own specific function; however, the most important aspects of the house are oriented east/west while the supporting features are oriented north/south.

The north and south wings are the most public parts of the house that connect to the central living area.  The south wing consists of a covered walkway that leads from the center of the house to the carport.

The north wing is the guest’s quarters that are publicly accessible, but retain their private needs as they are separated from the rest of the house.  The west wing of the house is the service wing, which is fairly secluded from the rest of the open plan design.  The east wing is the most privatized aspect of the house as it is the Kaufmann’s master suite.

The house’s swimming pool is one of the most iconic and recognizable aspects of the Kaufmann House; however, it is not solely a photographic gem or simply a recreational feature.  The swimming pool creates a compositional balance of the overall design of the house.  The house alone is unbalanced and heavy as the wings are not equally proportioned, but with the addition and placement of the swimming pool there is a cohesive balance and harmony throughout the design.

The low, horizontal planes that make up the pinwheel design bring the house closer to the landscape making it appear as if it is hovering above the ground.

The floating effect is emphasized through a series of sliding glass doors that open up to cover walkways or patios. The way in which Neutra designed the Kaufmann House was such that when the sliding glass doors were opened the differentiation of interior and exterior was blurred as if it was a sinuous space.

The flow from interior to exterior space is not simply a spatial condition rather it is an issue of materiality that creates the sinuous experience. The glass and steel make the house light, airy, and open, but it is the use of stone that solidifies the houses contextual relationship.  The light colored, dry set stone, what Neutra calls “Utah buff,” brings out the qualities of the glass and steel, but it also blends into the earthy tones of the surrounding landscape of the stone, mountains, and trees.

The Kaufmann House has gone through several owners after the Kaufmann’s owned the house, which led to the house to fall in disrepair and a lack of concern and preservation of the modern dwelling.   However, a couple that appreciated 20th Century modern homes restored the house back to its original luster with the help of Julius Shulman. The Kaufmann House is now considered to be an architectural landmark and one of the most important houses in the 20th Century.

Text description provided by the architects. This museum on the bank of the Tiber River has been designed as a renewed setting for the Ara Pacis, a sacrificial altar dating to 9 B.C. and now located on the western edge of the Piazza Augusto Imperatore. Planned as part of an effort to protect Rome’s cultural legacy, the new structure replaces the monument’s previous enclosure, which was in a state of advanced decay. The structure consists of a long, single-story glazed loggia elevated above a shallow podium providing a transparent barrier between the embankment of the Tiber and the existing circular perimeter of the mausoleum of Augustus, built circa 28 B.C.

The altar was relocated from the Campo Marzio in 1938 during the Mussolini era, and a system of regulating lines was applied to the project to relate the altar’s present position to its original site. Bisecting the distance between the present center of the mausoleum and the original site yielded a four-square urban grid that was used as a proportional frame to reorganize the piazza and its surroundings. An artificial obelisk is used as a historical reference on the north-south axis through the altar.

The clarity of the volumes and the building’s proportions relate in scale to Rome’s ancient structures. A predominating feature of the new building is a glass curtain wall measuring 150 feet long and 40 feet high. The asymmetrical entry hall, defined by seven slender columns in reinforced concrete finished with white waxed marble plaster, leads to the main hall, which houses the Ara Pacis. The contrast between the subdued lighting of the entrance space and the expansive top-lit and rigorously symmetrical main hall encourages a naturally progressive circulation. The roof over the main hall rests on four columns with skylights to maximize natural lighting and to eliminate “false shadows.” Outside the main structure, a low travertine wall extending from within the main hall traces the ancient shore of the Tiber River. Building materials include glass and concrete and an indigenous fine beige Roman travertine.

One of the unique features of the region in which the museum is located is the series of medieval castles that line a 35-mile stretch of the river Rhine. The Arp Museum, sited on a wooded escarpment overlooking the Rhine, is intended to respond to and echo the forms of these captivating relics.

The lowest level of the station functions as the main entrance to the new museum building, which is reached only gradually by a series of carefully modulated tunnels and shafts that burrow into and up through the mountain to the new building.

The first of these subterranean sequences begins from this lobby, which leads to a 40-meter-long tunnel—illuminated by two continuous bands of light—that extends below ground under the railway tracks to an exhibition pavilion that stands independent of the main museum building. The modest pavilion features polished concrete floors and a discreet slotted skylight; aside from providing ancillary temporary exhibition space, the pavilion also establishes a sense of expectation and uncertainty that is further reinforced by the next sequence, which materializes as another subterranean tunnel, this time 35 meters long and terminating at the bottom of a dramatic 40-meter-high shaft with access to two glass-enclosed elevators. These elevators ascend through the shaft to a conical tower structure above grade. Here the translucent tower walls illuminate the shaft and elevators, with added illumination and hints of views provided by transparent glass slots in the tower walls. At the tower’s apex the elevators open onto a 16-meter-long, glass-enclosed bridge which represents the final stage of the sequential promenade into the museum.

The entry to the museum’s ground floor is flanked to the right by a freestanding staircase leading to the lower and upper levels and to the left by a void overlooking the lower-level lobby. In addition to the lobby, which offers visitors an opportunity for rest and repose, the lower level features a classroom, administrative offices, service facilities, and access for shipping and receiving art. In fact, the oversized service elevator, designed to facilitate the movement of art, also functions as the visitors’ elevator and provides a galvanizing core around which the gallery spaces on the ground and upper floors are organized. More specifically, at the ground level these spaces include two large galleries with access to two terraces, as well as a smaller enclosed gallery. The spaces on the upper floor are distributed in the same manner as on the ground floor; however, rather than opening onto terraces, the two large galleries on the upper floor occupy a seemingly free-floating platform supported by columns so that they overlook the ground floor galleries at the east and west edges. The two main upper-level galleries are illuminated from above by a ceiling composed almost entirely of glazing, with a series of 2-foot-wide adjustable aluminum louvers providing complete daylight or daylight modulated with artificial light. A similar, though immobile, louver system occupies the double-height glazed facade facing the Rhine, opening the museum to breathtaking views of the surrounding valley.

The design of the Arp Museum represents a unique and seamless integration of history, art, architecture and nature. The hillside siting, amongst a gathering of medieval castles, with the landmark railway at the Rhine’s bank side presented a challenge and opportunity to bring a modern texture to the historical fabric of Rolandseck.

The use of the railroad station as a portal and the design of the entry sequence is integral to this ideal of relationships between interior and exterior, past and present.  Traveling through the exhibition spaces within the rail station, through the tunnels and shafts into the tower and over the bridge makes the experience of entry part of the museum experience as a whole.  The double height glazed façade and translucent quality brings the light and extraordinary surroundings into the space as well.

At the tower’s apex the elevators open onto a 16-meter-long, glass-enclosed bridge which represents the final stage of the sequential promenade into the museum.The first of these subterranean sequences begins from this lobby, which leads to a 40-meter-long tunnel—illuminated by two continuous bands of light—that extends below ground under the railway tracks to an exhibition pavilion that stands independent of the main museum building. The modest pavilion features polished concrete floors and a discreet slotted skylight; aside from providing ancillary temporary exhibition space, the pavilion also establishes a sense of expectation and uncertainty that is further reinforced by the next sequence, which materializes as another subterranean tunnel, this time 35 meters long and terminating at the bottom of a dramatic 40-meter-high shaft with access to two glass-enclosed elevators. These elevators ascend through the shaft to a conical tower structure above grade. Here the translucent tower walls illuminate the shaft and elevators, with added illumination and hints of views provided by transparent glass slots in the tower walls. At the tower’s apex the elevators open onto a 16-meter-long, glass-enclosed bridge which represents the final stage of the sequential promenade into the museum.The entry to the museum’s ground floor is flanked to the right by a freestanding staircase leading to the lower and upper levels and to the left by a void overlooking the lower-level lobby. In addition to the lobby, which offers visitors an opportunity for rest and repose, the lower level features a classroom, administrative offices, service facilities, and access for shipping and receiving art. In fact, the oversized service elevator, designed to facilitate the movement of art, also functions as the visitors’ elevator and provides a galvanizing core around which the gallery spaces on the ground and upper floors are organized. More specifically, at the ground level these spaces include two large galleries with access to two terraces, as well as a smaller enclosed gallery. The spaces on the upper floor are distributed in the same manner as on the ground floor; however, rather than opening onto terraces, the two large galleries on the upper floor occupy a seemingly free-floating platform supported by columns so that they overlook the ground floor galleries at the east and west edges. The two main upper-level galleries are illuminated from above by a ceiling composed almost entirely of glazing, with a series of 2-foot-wide adjustable aluminum louvers providing complete daylight or daylight modulated with artificial light. A similar, though immobile, louver system occupies the double-height glazed facade facing the Rhine, opening the museum to breathtaking views of the surrounding valley.The entry to the museum’s ground floor is flanked to the right by a freestanding staircase leading to the lower and upper levels and to the left by a void overlooking the lower-level lobby.

Text description provided by the architects. The Roadside Service Station There is a long and rich history of the service station within Australia. The familiar image of the large floating roof providing shelter to the amenities of the service provider is a strong memory for all who have undertaken a road trip. It performs a vital role in the rest and re-supply needs of the traveler. These places mark a point in a journey, a place for pausing, a place for reflection. The roof serves as both shelter and icon, signaling to the passerby while serving the practical function of sheltering the amenities below. Our project celebrates this imagery.

The Civic Monument Monuments are an integral and familiar part of cities and towns. They provide a valuable insight into the culture of a place and locate it within a broader history. Our building is placed on a plinth that raises it out of the flood plain and gives the structure a civic monumentality that encourages readings and understandings beyond the notion of the ‘toilet block’. This building is to be read as a gateway to the Calder Woodburn Memorial Avenue (CWMA) and also to the larger Shepparton Area.

The Diagram The diagrams represent the nucleus of an idea. The diagrams describe the disbursed nature of planting within the landscape, in particular the prominent trees such as the CWMA, and suggest a way in which this might be focussed around a single civic structure.The diagrams also suggest a different reading of this landscape by directing the views through a series of elements, in much the same way as the trees within the Avenue provide fleeting glimpses and frame the expansive views of the flood plains beyond.

Materiality and Construction The construction of the toilet blocks themselves utilises standard road building techniques of pre-cast concrete units located on a reinforced concrete slab. This process minimises on-site time, labor and construction costs. The steel-framed roof is then built over these units to provide shelter.

The cylindrical units are reminiscent of pre-cast elements used in road and bridge building that one encounters by the side of the road. The interior partitions are constructed from brightly coloured glazed bricks providing a ‘jewel-like’ visual contrast to the internal concrete shell. Materials have been chosen for their robustness and low maintenance.

Siting The siting of the structures is designed to emphasise the linearity and contained views of the CWMA. The main iconic toilet block acts as a signpost to the rest station with uninterrupted views to and from the Highway. The arrangement of the remainder of the facility is in a series of bands that screen different areas such as the carpark from the picnic areas. Expansive views of the floodplains to the north open up as one moves through these layers.

Text description provided by the architects. The Deichmann square and the Negev Gallery constitute a link between Ben-Gurion University campus and the city of Be'er Sheva. The square serves as an entrance gate to the western side of the campus, surrounded by existing buildings and the future Negev Gallery. The square offers an outdoor space for cultural and social activities for students and for the city population.

The square is bordered by the elongated structure of the gallery facing both the city and the campus .Towards the city, the gallery's continuous façade (160 meter in length) unifies the heterogeneous appearance of the existing buildings behind the gallery into a cohesive urban unit. The city façade is accompanied by a sculpture garden creating a green edge to the campus. The two story high monolithic body of exposed concrete emerges from lawny topography of the northern part of the campus and hovers above an entrance courtyard in the southern part, where it appears to be leaping towards the urban space.

The gallery hosts exhibition spaces, museology faculty, workshops and auditorium contributing to the outdoor activities on Deichmann Square. Since the square was designated to accommodate intensive congregation of youth and students, the preferred solution was to allocate limited areas for vegetation. The design of the square with various elements of exposed concrete connects the surrounding buildings both physically and visually, accentuating their common features.

Text description provided by the architects. From box to hypercube. This brand new commercial building is a part of a wider urban district planned from Spacelab Architecture since 2006 in the city of Porto Sant`Elpidio - middle Italy, in the course of completion. The client brief was to realize the maximum formal impact in the limits of precast construction and basic tipology dictated by the medium-commercial function. We intended this limits as an occasion to conduct the modular precast construction to new formal results. 
Save this picture!
Mixing two structural systems {precast concrete grid + metal reticular truss}, the box resulting from urban plan parameters {maximum surface and height} is made more complicated in the entrance side by a tridimensional prismatic intrusion in the original volume, distinguished by using glass and other traslucent materials in comparison to other opaque fronts. 
Save this picture!
The result is a distorsion of perception near the main facade overlooking the public space, inside a more basic/stereometric frame. The other sides are charaterized by a precast custom-made concrete envelope, which module is denied by a continue abstract texture visually connecting each panel to the contiguous. Windows are obtaided by subtracting material inside the texture pattern.

Their entry was selected as one of two first prize winners. More images and architects’ description after the break.The driving force behind Fargo 365 is the conviction that a truly public space is accessible 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Creating a place like this in North Dakota means accounting for wide, sometimes extreme variation in climate conditions. An often-used strategy in extreme climates is to move the public space indoors into skyways or indoor malls. However, issues of access, control, ownership, and governance, not to mention the lack of sunlight and fresh air, make an indoor public space problematic. In light of this, Fargo 365 envisions outdoor, truly public space for Fargo. Where climate conditions present a design challenge, they also presents an opportunity to celebrate the uniqueness of the region. With a contextual and climate-sensitive building form, integrated with cutting edge technology and public art, Fargo 365 celebrates the unique aspects of life in Fargo ND.The driving force behind Fargo 365 is the conviction that a truly public space is accessible 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Where climate conditions present a design challenge, they also presents an opportunity to celebrate the uniqueness of the region. With a contextual and climate-sensitive building form, integrated with cutting edge technology and public art, Fargo 365 celebrates the unique aspects of life in Fargo ND.Fargo 365 begins by wrapping Fargo’s new civic space with a mixture of uses – residential, retail, and office space – providing a variety of activity and visitors throughout the day. The design then carves into the street wall in important locations to allow street life to flow in and out of the space from all sides, giving emphasis to the connection between Broadway and 2nd, while still holding the 100% retail corner at that intersection. The architectural forms manipulate micro-climate conditions by placing the higher structures to the north of the site, buffering the northern winter winds and opening up to the south sun and summer breezes. In addition, the alley-like connections between buildings require special consideration in order to avoid creating wind tunnels while still creating a public, pedestrian thoroughfare. As such, the pinched form serves a dual function. The narrow space at the mid-point creates control point to modulate the air flow through the space and best take advantage of passive heating and cooling opportunities, while flared edges keep the passageway inviting to the public and open to the sky.Fargo 365 begins by wrapping Fargo’s new civic space with a mixture of uses – residential, retail, and office space – providing a variety of activity and visitors throughout the day.

The narrow space at the mid-point creates control point to modulate the air flow through the space and best take advantage of passive heating and cooling opportunities, while flared edges keep the passageway inviting to the public and open to the sky.Supplementing the underlying form, emerging renewable energy technology and public art are integrated throughout the design. Geothermal heat pumps, installed in conjunction with the necessary structural caissons, work to create a stable micro climate: cooling the buildings in the summer and warming the buildings and deicing the open space in the winter. In addition to practical considerations, the outdoor heat vents also afford the opportunity to create dynamic sculptural forms that will change daily through the freeze-thaw cycle. Vegetated walls line a network of tall, narrow, indoor atrium spaces and provide energy savings through active photoremidation that filters and recycles the air already within the system. Integrated Concentrating Dynamic Solar Facades on all south-facing walls alleviate the dilemma of choosing between access to sunlight and views on the one hand and renewable energy on the other. Vertical axis wind turbines generate energy on site by harvesting the winds redirected by the sculpted building forms and create an iconic presence on the Fargo skyline.Supplementing the underlying form, emerging renewable energy technology and public art are integrated throughout the design.

A 30 foot high interactive screen anchors the plaza on the east face. The screen’s liquid crystal pixels, which can become transparent or opaque, respond to and express the movement of people in the plaza and skywalk. The public becomes part of a performance in which they are both actor and audience. Additionally, the surface of the public space recalls the iconic prairie potholes landscape of North Dakota, with the pavement opening up to hold water, plantings, and fountains in the summer, and exposing thermal vents heated by the geothermal system in the winter.Perhaps, most important of all, the design seeks to integrate itself into the identity of the community, drawings inspiration from the uniqueness of the region and inspiring a sense of pride and community.

The sloping forms create places for sun bathing, picnicking, and watching performances in the warmer months. In the winter months, those slopes become perfect for sledding, or catching a few rays of warm mid day sun.

Text description provided by the architects. The Project is born over the remains of an ancient, about 120 year old cottage. It had a popular, architectural typology of the region, this means, one floor with two spaces, facing   the south, with the rooms in both sides of the central circulation and spaces of chambers and under covers in the upper floor.

For taking roots with the places history, the first decision is to lean us on the remains of the ancient house.

On the other side the demolition material is recycled for its relocation in the same height of the ground floor.

The new executed area, where once the corral was situated, is now like an ambiguous space, without use, sensorially opened to the exterior. The selection of the peaces remaining of the demolition, depending of their sizes, lets us alter the degrees of the hollows in function of the orientation. The remaining space between this filter-skin, executed with cages of stone (were they corrals?) and the waterproof skin of carpentry allows a permanent ventilation.

The project below is the Honorable Mention Winner, BLOCK 39: Centre for Science Promotion in Belgrade, Serbia designed by RTA-Office. The public, cultural and college building was designed by RTA-Office’s teams in both Barcelona and Shanghai. The conceptual framework of the building is to generate an event: an institutional, urban expression pole that becomes an international lure. The studio seeks to achieve the occupation of the site and its transformation, to provide guidelines for a new fluid system of urbanism that liberates the space and repurposes it for an open, continuous program for its users.The project below is the Honorable Mention Winner, BLOCK 39: Centre for Science Promotion in Belgrade, Serbia designed by RTA-Office.

Block 39 is laid out so as to allow visitors to explore the many different access points and paths through the building, all of which pool into the spacious lobby. The intersection of the main axis that make up the cross form a spectacular hall in a central space. The spaces at the extremities of the building are public programs which include a bookshop, the Science Club, permanent exhibitions, a restaurant, planetarium and conference hall.

In contrast, the steel on the cuts and cracks stand out exactly where the outside and inside meet, giving the building fenestration from above and along the walls for natural light and selected views of the surroundings.

RTA-Office was very conscious of the environmental and sociological impact that the building would have and considered three fundamental pillars, economic aspects, sustainability and quality of life, when designing the proposal in preparation for LEED certification and a target energy efficiency of 70%.Firstly, the project seeks to use high technology structures in place of reinforced concrete, and the use of native materials to ensure high resistance, long life, reduction of CO2 emissions and reduction of transportation impacts. The proposal was also designed to make use of the rain-water and gray water for garden irrigation, public toilets and cistern refill. CO2 and COV detectors were also considered to maintain the air quality of the proposal under the Health and Productivity standards of the European Community.Firstly, the project seeks to use high technology structures in place of reinforced concrete, and the use of native materials to ensure high resistance, long life, reduction of CO2 emissions and reduction of transportation impacts.

Text description provided by the architects. The buildings of the Estonian University of Life Sciences are located at the North-Western edge of Tartu, bordering with Tähtvere forest park. The institution set out to integrate its campus and freshen its image with innovative architecture achieved with the help of open architectural competitions. In 2007, the competition for a new sports hall was held, followed by a competition for new auditorium annexes for the forestry building in 2008.

The chosen plot for the sports hall was an empty, flat field right at the roadside at the entrance to town, so in addition to functionality and ability to integrate and organize the surrounding campus area, the competition, in a way, expected a greater degree of representation than the building type would normally imply. At the same time, the spatial programme of a sports hall largely prescribes the possibilities of designing the main volume. We decided to stretch all corners of the cubic volume, and to integrate the building organically with landscape.

Elevated ground forms a „cushion“ for the slightly entrenched building, thus optically minimising its volume, and continues in undulating forms, encompassing outdoor sports grounds and bicycle paths, towards a sloping valley further away. The streched-out corners of the building create concave lines both in plan and elevation, gently relating to landscape and softening the size of the building. At the same time the building retains sharpness, enabling constantly varying, expressive views from various angles.

This is due to optical effects of the form, clear-cut lines and finishing materials – glass on the longer sides of the building and larch cladding with wooden snags (nicknamed „hair“) on the shorter ones. The latter also add to the subtle play of overall optical effects, being shorter and denser in the middle, and longer and more widely placed at the edges. The snags coloured red form the name of the building – EMÜ spordihoone.

In the interior, the same attitude continues – a limited repertoire of considered details and takes. Moving around, the overall feel is light and airy, easy to navigate. The streched-out plan creates unconventional interior spaces. The choice of colours and materials is strictly limited to smooth exposed concrete and painted carroty surfaces with details in matte and shiny black. Irregularly placed bubbly interior windows opening towards the ballgames hall add a touch of frisky lightness and are echoed in the round glazed openings in gallery floor. In a delicate way, one is reminded that a sports hall is a bodily space – e.g. the concave outline of the building creates galleries narrowing in the middle, and with glazed openings in the floor the resulting space sharpens one’s bodily experience of space.

Text description provided by the architects. The lecture hall building of the University for Mining and Metallurgy of Leoben was planned and constructed in the early 1970s altogether in line with modernistic and functionalistic architectural thinking. It is part of a building complex consisting of several faculty buildings, workshops and laboratories organised along an access tract and connected with existing buildings from the 19th century but otherwise insensitive to the urban context.

Besides the thermal improvement and adaption of building services a fundamental functional rearrangement of the building was necessary, since the University organises a large number of high-profile symposia and conferences as a result of its research activities which was leading to conflicts with everyday university operations. Moreover, we were interested in the unresolved urban planning situation. We decided to respond to both problem areas with a new, vaulted layer of construction facing the public area. This new curved building responds to the flow of the street and the prominent location of the complex at an important roundabout. From a functional point of view, the new building takes on the task of either separating or connecting processes within the complex as required. It is now possible to stage presentations and receptions independently from everyday university business - normal lecturing in the two smaller halls runs independently. When not booked for events the additional areas have become an attractive lounge area for students. New useable areas were also created on the ground floor – an additional lecture hall and new seminar rooms.

During the building process the conrecte building structure was revealed and showed beautiful ribbed ceilings. This discovery influenced our design concept and we decided to work with these “historical” features. Our design decicions can be seen as interpretations of what already lay before us. We left the reinforced concrete ceilings visible in all access and casual meeting areas, sanitised them with some paint and applied acoustic and lightning measures in an extra layer suspended from the ceiling.

In the lecture halls the design aspect were reduced to a minimum in order to emphasise the “functional” character of these rooms. In line with its variety of usage requirements, the Audi Max is not only a lecture hall but also substantially more extensively equipped as a conference and event hall. Therefore it is furnished more lavishly, still the design of its walls and ceiling reflects the linear and orthogonal taxonomy of the entire complex.

The question as how to design the façade was of particular interest. The smooth grey aluminum surface highlights the curvature of the enlarged first floor. The large window aperture indicates the foyer and the entrance of the Audi Max. Through this large glass surface the foyer communicates actively with its surroundings. Vertical, white-painted steel slats featuring high and low points according to a defined pattern cover the building with something like a landscape image. Depending on the point of view, changing lighting situations throughout the day and individual traffic in the street the façade will yield ever-changing impressions of the building.

Text description provided by the architects. The 20th Century was one of the most inspiring and progressive centuries for the discipline of architecture; Richard Neutra was one such contributor that has left his mark on modern architecture with his advancement of residential design. Prior to the Kaufmann House, Neutra design the Lovell House for Philip Lovell and his family in Los Angeles, California between 1927-1929. The Lovell House was the turning point in Neutra’s career, putting him on the architectural radar.

The Lovell House was designed for the active, health conscious Lovell family in the hills of Los Angeles.  The house is an early example of the International Style in the United States that evokes principles that were developed by Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright.

The house consists of a series of overlapping planes that do not stick to Wright’s proportionality; rather they are a hybrid of Wright’s planar devices combined with Le Corbusier’s stark, streamlined aesthetic.

The house clings to the side of a steep cliff; it is perpendicularly suspended to take on the panoramic views of Los Angeles.  Since the house is suspended perpendicularly, the volume of the house is disconnected from the street, which is bridged by a concrete walkway that brings the inhabitant into the upper level of the house, which is the living quarters, and issues them down a large staircase encased in glass that leads into the living room and to the pool outside.

The lower level of the house, the living room, follows an open plan that leads out to the patio and swimming pool.  It’s outside near the pool that one begins to understand the spatial organization of the overlapping planes and the pilotis that support the cantilevering volumes.

The Lovell House is reminiscent of Le Corbusier’s style and aesthetic. The stark while walls stand out among the wooded terrain; the ribbon windows offer expansive views and a significant amount of light to enter the interior spaces.

It’s clear that Neutra was influenced by the International Style and Corbusier’s villas, so much so that the way in which one enters and moves through the house is similar to Corbusier’s architectural promenade; however rather than ending at the roof garden the occupant moves from the top of the house towards the patio and swimming pool on the lower level.

The Lovell House is claimed to be the first house in the United States to use a steel structure that is typically found in skyscraper construction – Neutra learned these new techniques when he was working in New York and with Holabird & Roche in Chicago.

However, the steel construction is not just supported by steel columns, beams, and pilotis, but it is only part of the structural system of the house.  Because the house is suspended on the side of a cliff, it is tethered to  the cliff by a tension cable that is tied into the rocky terrain. The house’s construction is rather interesting in addition to the steel structure integrated with tension cables; the house is actually one of the first uses of gunite .

Text description provided by the architects. With the ability to make even the simplest and straightforward programs spatially dynamic and in a constant state of redefinition, Rem Koolhaas and his firm OMA have redefined the term that “a house is a machine for living” in their design of Maison Bordeaux. Completed in 1998, Maison Bordeaux sits on a small cape-like hill overlooking the city of Bordeaux.

The house was designed for a couple and their family, but before Koolhaas and OMA were commissioned for the project in 1994 the husband of the family was in a life threatening car accident that left him paralyzed from the waist down. Two years after his accident, the couple approached Koolhaas to design them a new home outside of Bordeaux.  Despite having been paralyzed, the man did not want t straightforward house rather he wanted a complex design, stating: “Contrary to what you would expect. I want a complex house because the house will define my world.”

Koolhaas proposed a rather simple volume that was spatially complex and innovative in terms of the interior organization and conditions.  Koolhaas proposed a house that was the compilation of three houses stacked on top of one another; each with their own unique characteristics and spatial conditioning.

The house appears as three separate entities that fluctuate between opaque and transparent.  The lower level sits as a heavy mass that is carved into the hill.  The interior is cavernous and labyrinthian, in a sense, where all of the intimate activities of the family take place. The middle volume is the most transparent as well as the most occupied space in the house. It is the space for the living area that is situated partially indoors and outside offering extensive views over Bordeaux and allowing for a multitude of activities with its open plan. The top volume is similar to the lower level in that it is opaque and conceals the bedrooms of the children and the couple. Unlike the lower level, the volume is penetrated with port hole windows that create views for the residents from their beds.With each floor being inherently different it is perplexing as to how a handicapped man was able to live in such a spatially complex house.  Even though there is no duplicated, or repeated, organizational system, all three volumes are tied together by a central elevator that moves between each floor.  However, it is not simply just an elevator for vertical circulation between floors, but it is masked by the husbands office that provides access to the entire house moving from the kitchen, the lower level, all the way to the bedroom on the highest floor, which was driven by a large hydraulic piston that raised and lowered the room whenever necessary.

This ingenious idea of create a room that is capable of moving vertically through the house creates a spatial dynamism withing the house that is always changing and redefining the space of the office as well as the space where it stops.

With the three differentiated volumes stacked on one another, it appears as if the highest volume is floating on the middle volume because of the transparent glass.  With such a complex organization among floors, the overall structure of the house comes into question as to how these volumes stack up to one another.  With the third volume seemingly floating on top of the middle volume and actually cantilevering over it, one wonders how it could be supported.The cantilevering volume is supported by a steel tube that conceals a spiral staircase that extends throughout each level of the house.  In addition to the steel cylinder, there is an L – shaped brace that supports the back end of the house, which is complimented by a steel beam that runs along the roof that connects to a tension cable that is buried in the ground to stabilize the lateral loads – a signature of architectural intent by Koolhaas and Cecil Balmond.

Maison Bourdeaux is a masterful innovation of space that far exceeded the expectation of the clients wishes. Maison Bordeaux remains as a private residence that does not allow public visitors; however, regardless of its seclusion, it is still an innovative architectural landmark that was truly “a machine for living.”

Text description provided by the architects. What is long-lasting and what is recycle friendly was one of the key questions we were able to follow in the project for a metal recycle plant, where they first accumulate and then separate different waste metals and prepare them for reuse. The project consists of an immense production plateau and two small buildings on the edge of it.

We clearly divided the generic base, flexible for multiple-use and the very specific, non-flexible, therefore ephemeral and recycle friendly by its activity. In these terms the huge concrete plateau with a definition wall and attached concrete service building define the core of the current production, however they easily allow for change of program within the industrial zone. This huge part of the project required careful placing of the plateau in the environment ensuring least earth works and lowest possible concrete wall.

On the other hand, the small 100% metal office building works as a very specific control deck supervising the weighing of the incoming waste and out-coming metals. Since this specificity means non-adaptability we had to allow for easy and clear on-site recycling when this building is not needed anymore.

In contrast to the very rough production that goes on at the site we have embedded some abstract or we like to think “poetic” content in the project. The two buildings are of the same volume, but materially very different: one is made entirely out of concrete, whereas the other is all steel – from structure to cladding. Thus the two buildings speak about the context of material separation process of the metal recycle plant.

Text description provided by the architects. This project integrates 4 vital members, the first and most important, our client; who originated the concept and idea. Having the architectonic program, we attempted to give form to the rhetoric of the promenades in the countryside, idea that had to be implicit in the building.

Text description provided by the architects. The Openhouse is embedded into a narrow and sharply sloping property in the Hollywood Hills, a challenging site that led to the creation of a house that is both integrated into the landscape and open to the city below. Retaining walls are configured to extend the first floor living level into the hillside and to create a garden terrace for the second level. Steel beams set into the retaining walls perpendicular to the hillside are cantilevered off structural shear walls at the front of the site.

Lateral steel clear spans fifty feet between these beams creating a double cantilever at the leading edge of the house and allowing for uninterrupted views over Los Angeles. Front, side and rear elevations of the house slide open to erase all boundaries between indoors and out and connect the spaces to gardens on both levels.

Glass, in various renditions, is the primary wall enclosure material. There are forty-four sliding glass panels, each seven feet wide by ten feet high and configured to disappear into hidden pockets or to slide beyond the building perimeter. Deep overhangs serve as solar protection for the double pane glazing and become progressively larger as the main elevation of the building follows the hillside contours from Eastern to Southwestern exposure. This creates a microclimate which surrounds the building, creating inhabitable outdoor spaces while reducing cooling loads within. Every elevation of the house opens to capture the prevailing breezes to passively ventilate and cool the house. A vestibule at the lowest point of the house can be opened in conjunction with glass panels on the second floor to create a thermal chimney, distributing cool air throughout while extracting hot air.

Glass in the form of fixed clear plate panels, mirror plate walls and light gray mirror glass panels lend lightness to the interior spaces. These glass walls are visually counterweighted by sculptural, solid elements in the house. The fireplace is made of dry stacked granite, which continues as a vertical structural element from the living room floor through the second story. The main stair is charcoal concrete cantilevered from a structural steel tube. Service and secondary spaces are clad in floor to ceiling rift oak panels with flush concealed doors. Several interior walls are dark stucco, an exterior material that wraps inside the space. The use of cut pebble flooring throughout the house, decks and terraces continues the indoor-outdoor materiality, which is amplified when the glass walls slide away. The building finishes are few in number but applied in a multiplicity of ways throughout the project, furthering the experience of continuous open spaces from interior to exterior.

Set in a visible hillside area above Sunset Boulevard, the Openhouse appears as a simple folded line with recessed glass planes, a strong sculptural form at the scale of the site. The minimalist logic of the architecture is transformed by direct and indirect connections to the buildings' immediate environment. The perimeter landscaping is either indigenous or a drought-resistant xeriscape. An outdoor dining area implements artificial turf composed partly of recycled rubber. With the glass walls completely open the house becomes a platform defined by an abstract roof plane, a palette of natural materials, the hillside and the views.

Refurbishment in Architecture

Text description provided by the architects. The original builder of Park Avenue South was also the house’s first resident, who made the most of his triangular plot by allowing the side of the building to fan out to meet the line of the adjacent public footpath. On the ground floor this resulted in an additional fillet of space splitting the living and dining rooms. It was the divisional nature of this space (used as a utility room) that the client wanted to resolve. Further to improving the organisation of the plan, the Client was keen to enhance the relationship between the house and garden; the existing views were restricted in both orientation and size.

By relocating the utility room to the heart of the house, and integrating the kitchen and dining spaces the plan was reordered and paved the way for an extension that unified the principal rooms.  The design was developed through a series of folded paper sketch models exploring the nature of the triangular plot, the geometry and aspect.

elevation 01
The scale of the extension was governed by the parameters of the current permitted development legislation.  Volumetric calculations determined the maximum allowable capacity, which in turn formed a boundary to the geometric exploration.  The lines of the roof ridges were drawn out from two points on the rear wall of the house, whilst the elevations extended the lines of the living room and the external rear wall of the kitchen.

The structure is clad in black zinc with standing seams tracing a path across the roof.  From a distance, the structure reads as a strong geometric form that has grown out from the back of the house, but at closer quarters, its edges appear to soften and the malleability of the zinc cladding and the very slight billows in its surface come into focus. The impression formed is of a tailored garment turned inside out to reveal a complex structure of pleated seams.

Large areas of frameless glazing and triangular roof lights pierce the zinc allowing uninhibited views through to the light envelope of the interior.  Two solid doors lead from Assaluto Nero granite terraces - the larger door weighs 300kg into the extension.  The simple gesture of opening these doors dramatically changes the space: from a cocoon to a garden pavilion.

The white ash floorboards and white facets of the ceiling form a bright lining to the dark outer-shell. The open-plan space is divided by a long work bench clad in mitred Assaluto Nero granite. A step down into the kitchen allows this bench to form a counter top and cantilevered table.

This geometrically complex extension uses a lightweight steel frame to form a facetted surface for the glass and zinc roof. The setting out of the steel frame was immensely complex given the angles and twists of every beam. By digitizing a simple plywood model, detailed setting out drawings were produced.

The secondary timber structure allowed for the roof and the walls to be ‘super insulated’ offsetting the large area of glazing. All of the double glazed units had a low-e coating to provide an element of solar shading. Internally a tertiary timber structure was used to set out the feature internal plasterboard ceilings.

Traditional zinc details were modified to allow the standing seams to track up the walls and across the pitch and fall of the roof. Particular attention was paid to rainwater run off, integrating a gulley within the roof valley. Careful detailing at the head and cill of the doors enabled the drip details to be incorporated within the face of the cladding allowing the doors to sit flush with the external walls.

The use of VM zinc negated the need for a ventilation zone allowing the zinc to tuck over the aluminium glazing support angles. The matt black spacer within the glazing unit was then lined through with the internal finishes and the tailored feel of the building is complete.

The building plan is a thin strip, with narrow apartments opened onto two different scenes: one side the city, the other the wide private garden. Every unit has a room which crosses from side to side, opening simultaneously to both of them. We seek for dwelling with blurred frontiers between spaces, where inner room shape can be changed, and with the presence of an extra room. A room floating outside the building, attached to the facade, large enough to accommodate any domestic activity.

We approach social housing from present society, where customizing your own house is a way to seek for individuality. In this context, the new room, freely set in the facade, expresses this new understanding: a random image with all elevation being unique, every single dwelling different from each other, and only the intervention of the users helping it to acquire significance.

Text description provided by the architects. YN-13 House is organized on its site as three independent volumes enclosing a courtyard-like space with a swimming pool at its center.  The biased cut of the main house’s pitched roof and its protruding corners underscore primary views of the landscape and ocean. Conceived as a buoyant mass and inspired by historic Japanese residential structures in Kyoto and Kanazawa, the house’s unique siding design of western red cedar vertical battens and clapboard merge with the standing seams of the stainless steel roofing to visually unify the wall and roof surfaces.

The exterior’s western red cedar surfaces are expressed in various textures, and become smoother as they move from exterior to interior.  Tongue-and-groove siding is used to define outdoor rooms around the pool and the transition from exterior to interior at eaves and terraces.  The siding’s visual and tactile qualities elegantly blend the structure with its wooded surroundings, and over the course of a day the bleached siding and terne-coated stainless steel roofing lend the house an aura of both permanence and temporality.

site plan
The second level bedrooms are punctured with a series of openings and terraces providing light and views.  The western red cedar vertical battens of the façade seamlessly integrate the individual openings and structural posts of the railings into the volume of the structure’s form.  On the interior, the open, loft-like first level allows for an uninterrupted diagonal flow of space, and the expansive glazing at the corners connect indoor and outdoor activities. A large interior void joins the first and second floors with light and air and serves as a spatial counterpoint to the masonry chimney tower on the exterior.

The biased cut of the main house’s pitched roof and its protruding corners underscore primary views of the landscape and ocean. Conceived as a buoyant mass and inspired by historic Japanese residential structures in Kyoto and Kanazawa, the house’s unique siding design of western red cedar vertical battens and clapboard merge with the standing seams of the stainless steel roofing to visually unify the wall and roof surfaces.

Conceived as a buoyant mass and inspired by historic Japanese residential structures in Kyoto and Kanazawa, the house’s unique siding design of western red cedar vertical battens and clapboard merge with the standing seams of the stainless steel roofing to visually unify the wall and roof surfaces.The exterior’s western red cedar surfaces are expressed in various textures, and become smoother as they move from exterior to interior.  Tongue-and-groove siding is used to define outdoor rooms around the pool and the transition from exterior to interior at eaves and terraces.  The siding’s visual and tactile qualities elegantly blend the structure with its wooded surroundings, and over the course of a day the bleached siding and terne-coated stainless steel roofing lend the house an aura of both permanence and temporality.

On the interior, the open, loft-like first level allows for an uninterrupted diagonal flow of space, and the expansive glazing at the corners connect indoor and outdoor activities. A large interior void joins the first and second floors with light and air and serves as a spatial counterpoint to the masonry chimney tower on the exterior.The second level bedrooms are punctured with a series of openings and terraces providing light and views.

Text description provided by the architects. The Colorado River, which dissects the city of Austin, is a precious resource that this house very much embraces. Located on a long narrow river side lot, the house is conceived as a “floating fishing village” on the edge of a man made canal, where a collection of small gabled buildings and boardwalks mask the line between land and water.

From the street, a massive limestone wall conceals a guesthouse and office and forms the entry for the riverside compound. Once inside the wall, a 200 foot long boardwalk, the “grand entry hall,” connects the visitor to the rest of the rooms of the house. Bordering this walkway are several simple wood structures that house bedrooms and a study. These detached structures form a series of small courts and inlets off the canal offering private gardens for the additional bedrooms.

The main living room sits at the end of this boardwalk. The entry to the house is a two-story screened boathouse pavilion that offers views up and down the canal and out to Lake Austin. By capturing breezes off the lake in the warmer months and through the use of a large fireplace in the cooler ones, the space can be used throughout much of the year.

After passing through this screened entry, a broad indoor corridor overlooks the canal and connects the public and private areas of the house while also acting as a light-filled art gallery. Opposite the canal, a tall site wall of local limestone creates a private court for the master bedroom suite while dramatically framing views towards the lake.

Excitement at buying clothes and also to be shopping in a pleasant, comfortable, unique place. To make sure that the area is the setting for a pleasant, fun-filled experience.

Design at the service of the shop’s activity, never the other way round.The new H&M shop is found in the most commercial street of Barcelona, Portal de l’Àngel, in the building which was, until recently, the head office of the company Catalana de Gas. The original building, which is listed, is a vestige of the bourgeois architecture from the end of the 19th century, and is the work of Domènech Estapà, an architect who was opposed to the Modernista movement and more inclined towards a neo-classical style.

The listing was, on the one hand, a real headache in complying with the heritage regulations. But, on the other hand, it was an opportunity to work on a space with noucentista proportions; from a time when square meters were not measured in terms of profitability, hence the huge staircase and the empty space that reaches up into the dome. A genuine old-fashioned luxury. The fact that it is listed and the architectural style of the building were two premises that partly marked our project.

A genuine old-fashioned luxury.The change of use of the building was another conditioning factor for the project. We converted an area destined to be the offices of an important company into a modern clothes shop aimed, mainly, at young people, lovers of the latest trends. This meant approaching the project by trying to conciliate the “old” with the “new”. A remorse, bourgeois, baroque dialogue with a pop, modern, contemporary style.

We made a great effort to reform the building, highlighting the aspects which, over time and the different uses of the building in its latest stage, had been removed or altered. Things like the dome, the three public rooms, the staircase well and the imperial staircase. We were very respectful with the different architectural features. We made a great effort to reform the building, highlighting the aspects which, over time and the different uses of the building in its latest stage, had been removed or altered. Things like the dome, the three public rooms, the staircase well and the imperial staircase.We conceived an ephemeral interior architecture, composed of features that can be added and removed. A second exempt skin was superimposed on the old architecture, creating a new image, without blurring the original. This, which could have been an obstacle throughout the project, became an incentive as it finally helped us to achieve a multipurpose space which is flexible, modular and versatile. The objective, at all times, was to order the product to show H&M collections in the best possible way, which is why the second skin is neutral, in black and white.

Not just a rhythm in the formal aspect, but also in the intensity with which each area is experienced. To achieve this, we prepared surprises, changes of atmosphere, each with its own personality, different from the previous one. In this way, the route is more dynamic, as each corner creates expectation. Our aim was to add a “plus” of excitement and emotion for H&M customers.

To create furniture that responds to this modular need, we used metal that is superimposed and contrasts with the original wood and stone.

It is a flag ship, an insignia shop. A logistical laboratory in which we studied how to make a storeroom that would enable the rails to be continuously restocked. We also concentrated on on how best to display the clothes. We investigated new ways of showing them and making the most of them. Shelves, rails and hangers, modules, Meccano ceiling fittings were designed bearing in mind the various sizes of the garments and the H&M accessories. This shop was also conceived as a laboratory.

This entrance works as a shop window, shop sign and access. The communication between the interior and the exterior, which normally happens through the shop window, in this case consists of a virtual shop window. The pedestrian street is a flood of people that the entrance to H&M absorbs like a vacuum cleaner. To respect the façade, a minimal logo was placed.In the entrance, we started an explosion of light, colour and movement, through the LED screens.

In these three rooms, the contrast between old and new is more evident, as the wooden display cabinets, the chimneys and the original wooden dais have been preserved and share the space with the new metal furnishings.

We have emphasised the stairwell, the emptiness created by the staircase. The new staircase that has been built is not as important as the stairwell through which the light from the dome that tops the building travels. This central atrium communicates the floors and allows the natural light to pervade the interior. The cone is a metaphor, a symbol of rising up into the heights, a spiral towards the sky to capture the light. The staircase and the dome are two very important features of the alteration.

general plan 02
The orthogonal feel of the store’s two display walls offers a well-defined showcase to resident artisans. Each is provided with a dedicated space for his or her portrait, career path, birthplace and personal quote. On the floor, carved join-lines link the lower points of the wall to the straight edges of the central units that seem to push up from the floor. Also treated to a lick of chocolate brown, they are equipped with a retro-lit glass plate to highlight the products of the Maison des Maîtres Chocolatiers Belges. They become an exhibition zone according to the events of the year. Visitors can sample pralines and more than ten varieties of hot chocolate on site.

As for the typography, it is mix that reconciles the values of craftsmanship and tradition, on a blue ground that adds a luminous, contemporary touch.The orthogonal feel of the store’s two display walls offers a well-defined showcase to resident artisans. Each is provided with a dedicated space for his or her portrait, career path, birthplace and personal quote. On the floor, carved join-lines link the lower points of the wall to the straight edges of the central units that seem to push up from the floor. Also treated to a lick of chocolate brown, they are equipped with a retro-lit glass plate to highlight the products of the Maison des Maîtres Chocolatiers Belges. They become an exhibition zone according to the events of the year. Visitors can sample pralines and more than ten varieties of hot chocolate on site.The orthogonal feel of the store’s two display walls offers a well-defined showcase to resident artisans.

For me, the contrast becomes the definition that, which is natural, organic, changing, contains at different times, all of the colors of the rainbow. And that which is manmade should help to focus and intensify one’s perception of all that is around us.” “Whiteness is perhaps the memory and the anticipation of color.

He strongly believes in the role of architecture in government, education, private practice, and our local communities. Noting that architects in governmental positions often have more influence than those in private practice, emphasizing an architect’s role in our local communities and through non-professional organizations.  All architects can provide a very influential role helping guide public policy.

In 1969 MoMA exhibited work by the New York Five: Meier, Michael Graves, Charles Gwathmey, John Hejduk, and Peter Eisenman (Meier’s second cousin). The members of the New York Five, ‘a group of architects whose work, represented a return to the formalism of early modern rationalist architecture’ over time pursued different formal directions, however the most prolific builder of the group, Meier, continued to investigate the true Corbusian form particularly through the built environment.

That same year Meier garnered the prestigious commission for the $1 billion Getty Center in Los Angeles. Meier stated, “In my career, nothing can or will ever equal getting to be the architect for the Getty Center. Not only was it the most important event of my career, but as things worked out the project became inextricably inked with my children’s growing up.” In 1984 Meier was awarded the Pritzker Prize for Architecture, the youngest recipient of this award in the history of the prize.

New York-based ZERAFA ARCHITECTURE STUDIO shared with us their proposal for the International Competition to design the Museum of Polish History in Warsaw, Poland. More images and architect’s description after the break.New York-based ZERAFA ARCHITECTURE STUDIO shared with us their proposal for the International Competition to design the Museum of Polish History in Warsaw, Poland. More images and architect’s description after the break.Introduction The challenge of creating a new Museum of Polish History today involves considering the historical relationship between a National identity, collective memory and a culture’s traditions within a modern global context. The design of the museum and the crafting of a user experience that communicates an essential spirit of Polish Identity and is also meaningful to visitors from around the world represent a universal challenge of our time. We believe the solution lies within the power of history to illuminate, teach and improve relationships through the celebration of ideas and human aspirations. The collective memory of a Nation is quite often defined by those memories enshrined in national monuments and in particular, those not publically memorialized. The idea of a “collected memory”, one that is inherently fragmented and individual in character in relation to “collective psychology” that represents a group’s common ideas and aspirations is the starting point for our design.

The full exhibit gallery program is conceived as ten, 3-dimensional monolithic objects, a dramatic departure from the gallery defined exclusively as an interior space. Exposing the galleries to be viewed in the round, in space, adds a critical scale dimension to the program, one that is not typically legible in the museum experience. The galleries are given an impressive solidity and monumental scale, and yet many are floating in space- held up on virtual pedestals. It is the complexity of this dual expression of monumentality and lightness which defines the contradiction within the individual museum experience, celebration, judgment and the rejection of sentimentality. The ten gallery objects are juxtaposed to each other both vertically and horizontally to create a 3-dimensional cubic composition within and through a linear circulation volume. The objects are then push-in and pulled-out like drawers to create a series of interior voids and dramatic interstitial spaces.

Also, in this configuration, the in between, or accidental spaces can become important opportunities for surprise temporary exhibits and mobile museum events and program space.The ten boxes contain the five chronological divisions for the permanent exhibit program, the two temporary exhibition spaces, and the exhibition related educational zones. The free composition of the gallery boxes does not determine a particular distribution of the permanent galleries; but provides a flexible environment for multiple interpretations of how the galleries can be allocated and the relationships between them. The temporary exhibition space is located in two of the upper gallery boxes clustered together to provide a multi-height venue for temporary exhibits when required. The “high” temporary gallery is a 12m tall box which projects out of the eastern façade and through the roof structure to form a dramatic tower-like element suspended within the museum.

The connection between the two points is no longer the shortest distance between them. The tensioned geometry of its layout interferes with visual orientation and with the perception of dominating heights of “Serra da Estrela”, on one side, and with the vastness of Cova da Beira on the lower side.

Situated on a grass knoll and commanding views of Lake Anna in central Virginia, the house emerges as a long, white painted brick wall with a copper clad volume cantilevered above the wall.

The primary organizational elements are two “L” shaped brick walls connected by a glass enclosed bridge.  Mahogany clad walls combine with the smaller “L” to provide a service volume while glass walls combine with the larger “L” to create the primary living spaces and to provide southern and western views toward the lake.  The experience of arrival and the wall are intertwined as the wall establishes a threshold between the pine forest and views toward the lake.   Entrance to the house is thru the wall and into a space that divides the program of the house into public and private realms.

The entry, living and sleeping spaces are arranged linearly to maximize lake views and to take advantage of the southern exposure.  Large overhangs and sensored motorized shades combine to limit heat gain during the summer while allowing the sun to penetrate deep into the interior during the winter.

The second floor roof and exterior walls are wrapped in copper with fully glazed east and west walls inset from the ends of the copper volume.  The glazed wall at the east end provides an abundant and high source of light into the double height entry hall while the glazing on the west end provides light to two bedrooms and views of the lake.

A single, large punctuation in the southern copper clad façade allows views from a second floor office.  The sloping roof and canted front wall are designed to deflect fierce north wind and shed water from intense storms.  The geometric volumes are connected to the landscape both by the views from the interior and accessibility to the outdoors.

Throughout the project detailing is minimal and precise.  The spaces are ordered and there is a juxtaposition of solidity and transparency.  The rigor of the design, the linear organization of spaces and the continuous presence of the wall provide a sharp and intended contrast to the irregular beauty of the landscape beyond.  It is this contrast between an ordered human dimension and an unstructured natural condition that elevates our understanding and appreciation of both.

A research team led by Prof. Zhu Jingxiang of the School of Architecture at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has developed an advanced architectural system for the construction of the New Bud Study Hall in Sichuan this summer, based on the experience of building the first New Bud Primary School at Xiasi village in Sichuan’s Jiange County, which can be read about here. The new Study Hall is built to outperform the first New Bud Primary school in energy efficiency and space design, while retaining critical distinguishing features of the first school, such as earthquake resistance, durability and a short construction time of only two weeks. The new Study Hall is located in a remote minority village, Dazu, a hilly region of an altitude of 2,600 m on the border of Sichuan Province.A research team led by Prof. Zhu Jingxiang of the School of Architecture at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has developed an advanced architectural system for the construction of the New Bud Study Hall in Sichuan this summer, based on the experience of building the first New Bud Primary School at Xiasi village in Sichuan’s Jiange County, which can be read about here.

More on this project after the break.Professor Zhu and his team of thirty, comprised of mainland and Hong Kong university students, and architects, were supported by Hong Kong Drago Culture Charity Fund and the CUHK New Asia Sichuan Redevelopment fund as an ecological school prototype with innovative building technologies. The project was developed after the 5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake. Professor Zhu and his team of thirty, comprised of mainland and Hong Kong university students, and architects, were supported by Hong Kong Drago Culture Charity Fund and the CUHK New Asia Sichuan Redevelopment fund as an ecological school prototype with innovative building technologies. The project was developed after the 5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake.The Study Hall adopts a light composite structure system, with earthquake resistance reaching Mercalli Intensity Scale X. The building is built with a life span of over 20 years and is built with fire-proof, and weather-resistant materials. Over 90% of the components in the building system are prefabricated in factories, reducing the time taken to assemble the super-structure to only 14 days. The low construction cost makes the system an ideas options for areas that require hasty reconstruction or in areas threatening by natural disasters.

The low construction cost makes the system an ideas options for areas that require hasty reconstruction or in areas threatening by natural disasters.The building envelope is composed of 8 cm thick thermal insulation to resist cold weather, while vents are well-positioned to create a stack effect in order to cool the space in the summer and warm it in the winter. The LED lights installed in the Study Hall are powered by a wind turbine, keeping total energy consumption from lighting as low as 1.2 kw. Extra space is also reserved to install a solar ground heating system.

Extra space is also reserved to install a solar ground heating system.The design is a compact single-storey building housing three classrooms and a reading space, without wasting the precise 260 sq. meter space on corridors. Each room has distinct proportions and orientation in order to give its users a clear sense of location when inside. The classrooms are divided by translucent partition walls without keep out noise but allow light to enter. The Study Hall is abundant in scenic views of the nearby Lugu Lake and the village fabric. A simple timber-trellis cladding design allows the Study Hall to fit into the vernacular of the village while reducing the consumption of the raw timber required to build such a space.

Text description provided by the architects. In an effort to integrate living spaces with the outdoors while maintaining privacy from Burbage Lane and neighboring houses, the scheme is organized around a centrally located garden. With sixteen foot high ceilings, the eastern volume contains the public living spaces. Continuous clerestory windows assist in providing an abundance of natural light into the space, allowing views to the treetops and sky while minimizing the close proximity of the adjacent houses. A twenty foot wide glass wall slides into a pocket, enhancing the relationship to the outdoors, and provides a sense of living in a garden. The two story western volume is comprised of bedrooms and a small second floor living space. A one story glass link connects the volumes and visually opens to the central garden.

Modest houses on small lots comprise the Quillen’s Point neighborhood, adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay in Ocean View, Delaware. An eclectic mix of houses, gravel roads ending at the bay and wooded lots provide a nostalgic, informal setting for this new house. The project site is near the end of Burbage Lane, the second lot from the bay with expectations that the adjacent waterfront lot will eventually be developed.

The house was conceived as two simple, flat-roofed volumes, varying in height, intersecting and overlapping a one story circulation space which connects the volumes.  The east volume is constructed with cement board, the west volume with corrugated siding and the one story connecting space with the ground face concrete block.   The exterior material palette is quiet and subdued. Materials are selected for their expected long term durability, ease of installation and initial cost.  The impact of the one story horizontal volume facing the street is intended to reflect the scale of neighboring structures while the narrow two story volumes are oriented perpendicular to the street reducing their apparent scale.

This house is designed in strong counterpoint to many of the houses built in the last era of abundant resources, expensive materials, and limitless floor area.  The house is not large; it comprises three bedrooms and 2400 square feet.  The house is constructed with modest materials that include concrete floors throughout the first floor, oak flooring on the second floor and plastic laminate and oak millwork.

The house was designed to achieve a balance between recognition of the picturesque Chesapeake Bay landscape and a more intimate, secluded garden environment. Expansive openings to the private garden combined with smaller, selectively oriented openings toward the greater landscape allow for a sense of privacy while maintaining a sensibility of direct connection to the rhythms of nature.

Text description provided by the architects. The façade takes up the metaphor of transferring light energy to electric power with solar panels to achieve a uniqueness of the contour. The exterior walls are designed as a continuous wave of glass panels in the concept of “starting-folding-concluding“ to express the design ideas of “undulation, transference.” Half-unit glass and aluminum curtain walls are sectioned into 8 trapezoid units, finished with over 350 glass-cutting patterns. The perimeter of each floor varies with the advancing and recessing surface walls, and the trimming steel beam curving with the floor board serves as the fixed end of the curtain walls.

General use of low temperature systems for heating in combination with activation of the concrete core as thermal mass in order to keep the building on constant temperature. Natural ventilation of the huge air volumes within the building allows for minimization of the mechanical apparatus for ventilation heating and cooling. The atrium is conceived as a solar heated, naturally ventilated sub-climatic area. In the large volume individual areas can be treated separately by additional measures such as displacement ventilation.

Text description provided by the architects. The Paris Opera, or Palais Garnier, is the most famous auditorium in the world. With 2,200 seats, this opera house designed by Charles Garnier is admired as one of the most prominent architectural masterpieces of its time.

The Paris Opera was designed as part of the great Parisian reconstruction, which was initiated by Emperor Napolean III of the Second Empire. The emperor chose Baron Haussmann to supervise the reconstruction, first ordering that he clear 12,000 square metres of land on which the theatre was to be built. This would be the second theatre for the world renowned Parisian Opera and Ballet companies. An open competition was announced in 1861, which was won by Charles Garnier who was an unknown 32-year-old architect at the time.

Although the design of the building seemed to be just what Emperor Napolean III had in mind, the setbacks and natural disasters were not what the builders needed. Once construction had begun in 1862, it didn't take long before the workers realized a critical error in the location on which the opera would be built; the ground of the lot was extremely swampy, under which flowed a subterranean lake.

This delayed the pouring of the concrete foundation, as the water had to be continuously pumped out, lasting eight months. More setbacks troubled the builders, including the Franco-Prussian War, the subsequent fall of the Second French Empire, and the Paris Commune.

A fire raged for 27 hours straight in late October 1873, burning down the current theater known as the Salle Le Peletier. This added extra pressure to complete the new theatre, and the massive workforce was able to finish building the Palais Garnier by late 1874. It's inauguration followed soon after, in January of 1875, opening with a lavish gala.

As the home of the original Phantom of the Opera, it is said that the opera is haunted as a person was killed in 1896 by a falling counterweight of the grand chandelier. This incident inspired Gaston Leroux in the original writing of the play, as did the underground lake and cellars.

Palais Garnier is of the Neo-Baroque style, a term used to describe architecture that encompasses the key characteristics of Baroque style although built after the proper time period. The monumental style can also be classified as Beaux-Arts, with its use of axial symmetry in plan, and its exterior ornamentation. One of the major urban implications of the Paris Opera is it's location at the northern end of Avenue de l'Opera in France. It's role as the terminal axial point suggests that as a public space, it should hold much importance in the community.

The audience sits centered around a hanging chandelier, weighing over six tons, and the large stage was built to accommodate up to 450 artists. It is opulently decorated with marble friezes, columns, and statuary, many of which are used to portray deities from Greek mythology.The Paris Opera was meant to be a social gathering space for the people, which is reflected in the interweaving corridors, stairwells, landings and alcoves which allow movement of large masses of people while also permitting socializing during intermission.

The Paris Opera, or Palais Garnier, is the most famous auditorium in the world. With 2,200 seats, this opera house designed by Charles Garnier is admired as one of the most prominent architectural masterpieces of its time.The Paris Opera was designed as part of the great Parisian reconstruction, which was initiated by Emperor Napolean III of the Second Empire. The emperor chose Baron Haussmann to supervise the reconstruction, first ordering that he clear 12,000 square metres of land on which the theatre was to be built. This would be the second theatre for the world renowned Parisian Opera and Ballet companies. An open competition was announced in 1861, which was won by Charles Garnier who was an unknown 32-year-old architect at the time.The Paris Opera was designed as part of the great Parisian reconstruction, which was initiated by Emperor Napolean III of the Second Empire.

Text description provided by the architects. We originally started with the idea of the Morerava Cabins when we saw an opportunity to create a tourist complex on Easter Island in 2009. Analysing the tourist market on the Island we quickly realized most sectors were well developed, spanning from luxury Hotels to private homes and camping, however one niche sector was not covered: family friendly cabins which meet certain quality standards.

site plan
When we started to design the cabins we realized a very bespoke design would be required in order to correspond to the unique and delicate context of the island. The construction process, material resourcing and daily usage of the cabins had to have minimal impact on the very fragile environment of Easter Island. 
Save this picture!
Taking everything into account we developed the idea of a prefabricated design. The entire prefabrication was finally executed on the continent and then shipped by boat. This ensured minimal local impact and avoided the use of any material from the island. The design of the module emerges from the optimization of common materials available on the market. For example, modulation between pillars is 120cm is half the length of a plate, resulting in less waste of material. 
Save this picture!
Since the temperature on Easter Island is always close to the comfort zone (subtropical climate), it was not necessary to add thermal insulation, allowing what traditionally would leave the interior structure of the panels visible. This results in savings in material and workmanship and, as the timber structure is visible, creates an interesting design.

A space between ceiling panels and zinc cover thermally insulates the roof structure, allowing the natural air ventilation to remove any built-up heat.

In order to achieve minimal intervention with the natural terrain, all cabins hover over ground on single pillars. This preserves the natural water absorption of the earth and allows for natural air ventilation underneath the floor, eliminating any potential moisture problems. Additionally we managed to conserve local species of plants and shrubs making them an integral part of the overall design and ambience.

We implemented continuous windows on either side of the huts in order to allow for sufficient interior luminance and cross ventilation avoiding the need of any mechanical systems. The location of all windows prevent visual connections from cabin to cabin allowing for the necessary privacy amongst all visitors.

All Cabins have a rainwater collection system, which stores and treats the water for the re-usage in the cabins. Water from the network is only used in case this supply runs out. This avoids the over consumption of a resource which is rare on the Island. Hot water comes from solar heating tanks to the solar panels located on each cottage's roof, avoiding the use of gas or electricity (which in the island is generated from petrol).

Each cabin has 60 sqm plus 17 sqm on terraced decks and is equipped for up to 6 visitors.

Text description provided by the architects. Four decades after their project was featured in the 1969 Record Houses issue of Architectural Record, the owners sold the house to a young couple. A condition of the sale was that the new owners would respect the character of the project, yet be able to revisit and alter the contained quality of the interior rooms to create a continuous living space visually connected to the woodland site.

An analysis of the existing structure revealed ordering devices through which the new work could be understood. A truss roof system allowed interior walls to be eradicated, yielding a condition of an unencumbered public and private pavilion linked together by a glass entry node. Floor to ceiling window apertures relating the pavilions could not be experienced within the original floor plan.

Registering the new work to the existing house is a conceptual allee of walnut casework. The casework weaves together and provides clarity to the various living areas. The quarter sawn casework and flat sawn flooring employ walnut in a Chiascuro manner, creating bold contrasts to the existing white painted brick walls and plaster ceiling. Corian casework elements are positioned as kitchen, mudroom, and bath objects, further juxtaposing a smoothness to the textural brick and plaster.

Steven Holl shared with us his winning entry for the Hangzhou Normal University Performing Arts Center, Art Museum and Art Quadrangle in Hangzhou, China. The pair of buildings, situated on either side of the canal, are the heart of the new campus. Holl’s concept early on was two balanced forms, one additive as seen in the design of the Performing Arts Center, and one subtractive displayed in the design of the Art Museum. This dialogue between these two buildings, the utilization of local materials, and the carbon neutral section of the new university provides for a special moment within the campus.Steven Holl shared with us his winning entry for the Hangzhou Normal University Performing Arts Center, Art Museum and Art Quadrangle in Hangzhou, China.

Seats have bamboo backs with blue-green mohair upholstery.On the other side of the canal, the University Art Museum has a “subtractive” geometry with the voids carved in special glass bars, bringing diffused light to the galleries within. The concrete structural walls at the exterior minimize columns on the interior for exhibition flexibility. The charcoal-stained bamboo-formed concrete exterior gives a special texture to the walls, which are broken at the voids, lined in glowing planks of glass. These voids are also outdoor teaching spaces in their amphitheatre stepping, providing real variety and spatial energy in a museum of orthogonal walls designed to feature the art within. On the other side of the canal, the University Art Museum has a “subtractive” geometry with the voids carved in special glass bars, bringing diffused light to the galleries within. The concrete structural walls at the exterior minimize columns on the interior for exhibition flexibility.

Continuing our coverage of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SSE), OMA recently shared the latest photographs of the building while under construction. The building, located in the downtown area of Shenzhen, China, is expected to reach completion in April 2011. The SSE, a new headquarters for China’s equivalent of the NASDAQ, is 132,000 sqm of offices, registration and clearing house, accessory area, securities information company, SSE office area, trading floor and technical operations. The floating podium design, which is suspended 36 meters over a public plaza, projects 54 meters from the base of the tower. The building broke ground in November of 2007, Rem Koolhaas along with local government and the officials from the SSE were in attendance.

Text description provided by the architects. Designed to change people’s perception of healthcare, The Waldron is planned around a new civic square framed by the health centre, shops, and a 5-storey development with street level café. Inside, the 6,029 sq m health centre is organised around two courtyard gardens and a spacious foyer featuring a site-specific installation by artist Martin Richman.

ground floor plan
Located in the London Borough of Lewisham just north of London’s South Circular inner ring road, in an area in which housing estates and tower blocks populate a discontinuous landscape, the new centre replaces an anonymous single storey health centre with a significant urban development that has a greater capacity to shape the fabric of the locality and form a backdrop for public activity.

The site, a north-facing peninsula block, neighbouring New Cross station is bounded by streets on three sides and sits on the western end of a pedestrian route - Douglas Way - that links local amenities including a leisure centre, arts centre and school, shopping street (Deptford High St) and park (Fordham Park). Community allotments occupy the southeast quadrant of the peninsula itself.

The design demonstrates the practice’s interest in creating a public building with the presence of a civic landmark that has the capacity to shape the daily lives of those living nearby, whilst at the same time retaining a level of intimacy necessary for clinical consultation. The plan is generated from the patient’s perspective. The design seeks to describe a narrative journey in five frames beginning with the square leading inside first to a foyer, then cloister, waiting room and finally to a clinical room. The design conceives of a Z-shaped building that occupies the northeast and southwest quadrants of the peninsula and frames two contrasting public spaces – one, the existing allotments, the other, a new square in the northwest quadrant which opens up a diagonal route to New Cross station. The building rises from two storeys in the northeast to four in the southwest to complement the 3-storey brick Victorian school building on Stanley Street to the east. The concrete framed building is clad in a veneered rainscreen, which gives it a rich cherry wood colour redolent of Eighteenth Century furniture or a musical instrument casing, bringing a warmth and humanity to the building. Louvres on east and west elevations, acting both as solar protection and acoustic baffles, are fabricated from the same timber component further suppressing the repetitive windows. Bronze-anodised windows are variously proud, flush and recessed. Seen obliquely from the South Circular the Waldron appears as a large crafted timber cabinet in the city.

The square and west façade are framed by a canopy, concrete arcade and screen, all of which invite proximity and provide a counterpoint in scale and material to the greater building mass. Resting on the canopy are storey high super graphics WALDRON, HEALTH and CENTRE. Seen together they constitute a useful sign, but, seen apart, as they often are, they play a part in the composition of each elevation and in the sculptural and material character of the whole.

There are two key ideas at play in the design of The Waldron: the reciprocity between the social logic of the interiors and its capacity outwardly to shape or frame the allotments, square and adjacent streets; and, the dialectic between the homogenous largely timber elevations, in which the fenestration is evident and from certain viewpoints concealed by the fins; and the superimposition of the heterogeneous, both literal and abstract, counterpoint of the super graphic letters.

The square has a bitmac surface with resin bonded gravel strips in two colours - buff and grey - and is planted with London Plane and Redwood trees and lit by column lighting and populated with benches and cycle racks. It is framed on two sides by shops and in due course will be completed by a 5-storey residential building with a café on the north side of the square, the site for which has been sold to a private developer.

The Center for the Promotion of Science in Belgrade, Serbia by PIKASCH architecture studio is an architectural proposal focused on extrapolating the design elements out of the basic compositions of life, and using sustainable technology to promote the knowledge of and use of developing science.The Center for the Promotion of Science in Belgrade, Serbia by PIKASCH architecture studio is an architectural proposal focused on extrapolating the design elements out of the basic compositions of life, and using sustainable technology to promote the knowledge of and use of developing science.Read on for more images and information after the break. Read on for more images and information after the break.The basic conceptual elements of the Center for the Promotion of Science are based on the common ground that scientists share with the world that they observe and invent: the air, the water, the earth and its terrain, rivers, fauna and people. While man-made environment is the driving elements that makes the architectural proposal possible, the architects of the CFPOS seek to connect the users back to the basic elements, through tradition that searches the roots of civilization, and nature.

Permanent exhibition spaces are linked directly to the lobby, temporary exposition room and some services are placed in the basement. Visitors can climb up in two rocks onto some exposition platforms and viewpoints too. On first floor there is the Science Club and the restaurant – which is served from the ground floor logistic-area. On this floor visitors have a direct access to out-door science park, which is visually integrated to the hills, but separated from public areas by landscape elements.

The interior concrete walls are unfinished, and the floors are covered by concrete based finishes such as terrazzo or smoothened cement floor. The external skin of the structures are made of GFRC, which imitate stone but is light and strong. The rest of the skin is either green roofing or glass. The height requires a special truss skeleton which supports the vertical vastness of the space to promote the atmosphere of the composition.

Electric pumps are powered by white electric energy, the rest is served by our the earth. Optimally, the architects hope that as the design progresses, the whole composition of the elements will develop into a passive energy system that incorporates numerous sustainable energy approaches.

Text description provided by the architects. As in many of the civic and public buildings designed by Richard Meier & Partners Architects, The Atheneum built in New Harmony, Indiana plays a key role in its community.
Save this picture!
The Atheneum, located near the banks of the Wabash River at the edge of New Harmony, is the starting point for the tour of the historic town, and is intended to serve as a center for visitor orientation and cultural community events. Its architecture is conceived in terms of the linked ideas of architectural promenade and historical journey of one of America’s most significant utopian communities.

The ideal vision of the relationship between habitation and social life exists in the restored architecture of New Harmony.

Visitors arriving by boat land on a path that leads through a field to the building. A three-story plane set at a forty-degree angle to the podium acknowledges the point of arrival. Once the visitor has crossed the threshold, the entry box propels him to the foot of the internal circulation ramp. From here, the pedestrian circulation through the building is a continuous experience, of which the interior ramp is chief mediator and armature.

Third Floor, Courtesy of Richard Meier & Partners Architects
As the ramp winds upward from the orthogonal grid and regains the five-degree offset orientation of the path from the river, the entire building is set in motion; the geometry of overlaid grids inducing a sense of spatial compression at certain points, tension at others, with grids almost colliding.

This collision resonates throughout the complex interior as the ramp, illuminated by light from above, resolves the two grids in plan and section.

Upon reaching the exhibition space on the third level, the visitor can look back on the route he has traveled, through staggered interior slots and windows framing the essential spaces, as well as forward to what is to come. Framed views to the exterior allow controlled glimpses and anticipations of the town and the landscape.

At the uppermost roof terrace, the visitor finds himself confronted with the town. This small space affords a panoramic vista like that from the prow of a ship. Visitors descend by way of a second ramp--this one elongated and stepped, an uncoiled version of the interior one leading out of the building and into New Harmony itself.

The Eco-Temporary Refuge, designed by Andrea Jasci Cimini of CiminiArchitettura, is a proposal for a residence that can be deployed in mountain landscapes where recreational activities are available for tourists, climbers and hikers. The house comes as a substitute to permanent and invasive construction of housing that endangers the dedicated eco-systems of the mountains to promote this kind of seasonal activity. The zero-impact house is a sustainably-minded endeavor that simultaneously exploits and protects the natural environment.The Eco-Temporary Refuge, designed by Andrea Jasci Cimini of CiminiArchitettura, is a proposal for a residence that can be deployed in mountain landscapes where recreational activities are available for tourists, climbers and hikers.

The house accommodates up to six people, and is designed to sustain a comfortable environment in cold weather. It is equipped with 4 kW solar panels that power underfloor heating and electrical systems, appliances, and system transformation of snow into drinking water.The house embraces the snow as a thermal insulation and is used in the sewage treatment of the house, converting it to hot water. Windows are minimal and the glass used has a low-emissivity that has contributes to thermal insulation by trapping warm daytime temperatures in the winter. In the summer, the system works in an opposite way by opening and ventilating the house.

Exterior design is the first thing that the CGV users notice as they climb up the escalator to get to the entrance of the theater which is where we wanted to deliver the most impactful space design concept for all too see. The former Yongsan CGV theater was initially designed when big multiplexes were in demand therefore materials such as neons and metals were mainly used to purvey the cinematic fantasy concept in a forceful style. Redesigning and replacing the circular structure on the exterior space which was connected to the previously existing ceiling was the main concern for us especially considering the given budget and the construction process schedule. We tried to maintain the former structure yet by incorporating the pattern and combination of finishing materials we were able to create the dynamic rhythm for the space.

This concept mirrors the vitality of Yongsang CGV which draws the most theatergoers out of all the CGV multiplexes in Seoul. By simplifying to the maximum the types of finishing materials used and designing the patterns through maintaining the former structure we were able to pertain the edginess and young energy of younger theatergoers who are the major clientele of CGV Yongsan. The exterior design is the crucial space where one can feel this concept of dynamic rhythm the most. The theatergoers who climb up the escalator can fully sense the tension of rhythm emanating from the pattern of finishing materials. Utilizing the vertical repetition of the pattern without destroying the wood material plays up the characteristics of the site.

The atmosphere of the interior is that of a cozy cafe where we used the raw interior concrete block and UB block yet by applying the patterns from maintaining the structure of the finishing materials we were able to convey the feeling of liveliness. The furniture, furniture fabric, lighthing and interior decoration that are arranged have been processed simultaneously and have been carefully selected from the exclusive design product companies such as Zaisu Design Studio, Guillaume Delvigne, LUCIDIPEVERE and VISION 60.

Text description provided by the architects. This is a project where one cannot dismiss the personal dimension of the commission: the refurbishment of an attic for my mother-in-law, Canadian, my daughters' grandmother. It is a project that detects traces, records them, and leaves new prints for the ‘next one' that may wish to search. And the idea is to build it following a different protocol. This new construction protocol, its agents and that sort of mystique of the traces will be the ‘Project'.
Save this picture!
An oak wood dais of 140 millimeters over furried boards seems to be the appropriate canvas to register the levels of the traces and then build the dwelling on top in order to silence them. The work starts at floor level after the usual procedures of spatial and structural cleansing. That floor, that wood surface, shall unveil the encountered traces. On the one hand detecting the traces, discovering a network of concealed geometries that are outlined when laying the floors through a precise detailing of the boards; on the other, the new traces are stamped by drawing on top of the discovered geometries the portrait of the beautiful woman that will live in the house.

This involves a carpenter, an enthusiastic student of fine arts, Photoshop, the Xiladecor palette on the market, aniline and a set of gouges to engrave the drawing in the terrace. End of the first stage.The unveiled geometry and the three rear windows determine the repositioning of the partition walls that define the two bedrooms and bathroom required. And the leitmotiv of the next step of the building protocol is ‘on top and dry'. Everything built is dry and on top of... there are no interferences; not among the materials, not among systems, not among the guilds that participate. The trace of the portrait is silenced by placing the partitions and furniture on top. There are only wonderful stains on the floor. Perhaps the next resident will discover the secret.

The Water and Life Museums are born of the construction of Diamond Valley Lake (DVL), the largest man-made water storage lake in North America. Set in the semi-arid Southern California desert near Hemet, DVL is an integral part of the state’s water infrastructure. The lake provides a 6-month emergency supply of water for all of Southern California.

Text description provided by the architects. Shaped largely by the site, the Glenbrook Residence is conceptually a courtyard inserted between two heavy walls.  Threading the walls through the treescape to create distinct yet connected structures allows the house to be divided spatially into the most public, most private and a living pavilion that can become either or both.  The residual in-between spaces create outdoor rooms that engage the building.

site plan
The public and private wings of the house make up the foundations of the design concept.  They are thought of as being of the earth and are articulated through their materials and shape as heavy, static pieces.  These wings define the bounds of the house and act as the backbone to support the various courtyards, upper roof canopies and the dynamic living pavilion that sits between.

The living pavilion is conceived as the center-piece of the concept and glows like a crystal between the heavy wall elements of the house and contains the cooking, eating, and living spaces.

Above each of the heavy wings floats a thin, folding roof canopy.  More than a simple surface, this roof canopy is conceived as an entity where nothing is hidden and all six sides are exposed to view.  The walls that contain the spaces beneath these canopies are made of glass to create the illusion of a floating roof and to blur the boundary between inside and outside. All of these elements adopt a language of angular, dynamic forms in order to be completely liberated from the solid elements of the house.

Text description provided by the architects. As with many urban centers, Kansas City has a wonderful collection of turn of the century low to mid-rise buildings within the urban core. It is the re-use of older buildings that has promoted the ideal of loft living, having the city as a personal backyard. While many existing buildings still need to be renovated, 5 Delaware represents a new approach – a new, modern structure sensitively placed in one of the numerous empty lots downtown.More photographs, drawings, and project description of 5 Delaware Lofts by el dorado following the break.

Several years ago city officials along with the local development community seized an opportunity to revitalize the urban core. Through local, state, and federal incentive programs local developers, architects, planners, and municipal officials embarked on a massive effort to re-build the heart of the city. The results have been impressive. Over $3 billion dollars of investment has provided the creation of 15,000 new residents, over 99,000 new office workers, and hundreds of retail establishments. While similar efforts are occurring in other mid-western cities, Kansas City has been especially fortunate to have numerous local developers committed to the residential component of this successful venture. This commitment stems from the desire to re-energize downtown. A strong residential community supports this goal.

The site for this project is situated in the historic River Market area of downtown, within a few hundred feet of the bluffs that overlook the Missouri River. It is a corner lot at the south end of the block, sharing magnificent urban views with a variety of cafés, businesses and lofts. It is the vibrancy of the surrounding River Market neighborhood that drew the client to develop a project in this area.

The clients wanted  a new structure that would provide a unique urban living experience. Aesthetically, they asked the architects to create a building for buyers desiring sophisticated architecture.  They offered the shell and each tenant was given the opportunity to custom design each interior loft space. Requirements for the project included: covered and secured parking, maximizing the lot area, capturing the views, working within a construction budget of $68 / ft. and adhering to a 14 month design and construction timeline. Most importantly, el dorado's goal was to create a dialogue between existing fabric and modern infill.

El dorado embraced all the client’s desires and constraints by establishing an aggressive but methodical design process. This emphasized a collaborative relationship with not just the consultant team but also the client and the general contractor. The first step was to study the potential of the parking to residential unit ratio for the site. Fortunately, the site topography and lot dimensions worked well for an underground parking garage accessible from the alley on the east side and netting 23 parking stalls. The client determined that in order to create a higher end living environment, the project should comprise 13 units. Subsequent layout studies focused on how to arrange these units in a manner that adhered to the goals of the project. Site constraints determined that the common corridor should be placed on the north side and the units to be facing east, west, and south. The structural design quickly developed into a simple column grid that corresponded to the parking requirements below and then extruded upward through the third level. The fourth level was pulled back off the property line in order to create large outdoor rooftop patios.

The architects then explored multiple structural systems choosing cast-in-place concrete as the most suitable system. It was decided to utilize a two-way reinforced slab that would allow for flexible floor plates and a clean unobstructed ceiling surface. Concrete also permitted us to honestly express the material and the structural diagram on both the interior and the exterior of the building. This diagram was then articulated by utilizing recessed infill panels in a series of alternating opaque and transparent zones. These zones consisted of three materials intended to differentiate the common spaces and the residential spaces.

The first was a corrugated metal siding on the north, then wrapping around to the east and west elevations. The siding was also used to articulate the common corridors on the north elevation and provided us with an economical sheathing system. The second material was an aluminum storefront glazing system incorporating sliding operable doors and windows. These windows were used to express the structural diagram and provide each unit with optimal views of the city, creating an abundance of natural light. The third material was a natural stained Mangaris wood siding on the south of the building, wrapping the east and west elevations. This wood was used to create a warm contrast to the concrete, aluminum, and metal siding. All three materials converge on the east and west elevations creating a recessed pedestrian entry on west, vehicular entry on east, and porches above each entry.  As a finishing touch, el dorado fabricated and installed the guardrails, roof deck dividers, and entry awning themselves.

The surrounding neighborhood is comprised of brick paved sidewalks and tree grates placed every thirty feet. When it came time to integrate the sidewalk and landscaping design the architects followed a similar logic to the building. El dorado decided to maintain brick as the paving for the sidewalk for continuity but used the landscaping as an opportunity to accentuate components of the building design. On the west end we created two planting areas flanking the entry vestibule. The northern planting area was pulled out to the street and we used a combination of three intimately scaled red and white bud trees. South of the entry we kept the landscaping tight to the building and used only indigenous prairie grasses and junipers. The south side of the building demanded a slightly different approach. In order to soften the texture of the foundation wall we inset portions of the wall and planted a continuous strip of densely packed with Virginia Creeper vines. Finally, el dorado placed columnar maple trees in front of the wood panels so as to not compromise the views from within the unit.

He possesses a unique perspective on world architecture, because it is synchronous. But that which interests him is the life and interactions which evolve within and around these new structures, such as the large stadium by Herzog and de Meuron in Peking, or the Learning Center by SANAA in Lausanne, and also the Cultural Center of Medellín in Colombia, or the mud brick Ahmed Baba Library in Timbuktu, Africa.Iwan Baan has been invited to the villa so that he may share his visions, which are like so many stopovers in his many endless trips around the world.

The project aims to bring up the family to a multifunctional use of the spaces, without conventional limits. That's why we decide to give the existing big living room space a multiple function, being at the same time the owner's bedroom, the living and dining space and the relax area and to to dedicate the only existing room to the newborns.

Text description provided by the architects. The rainy city of Concepción, is located in the mouth of the Bío-Bío River, 520 Km south of Santiago. It has aprox. 220.000 inhabitants, but its threshold spans reaches some 630.000 people. The highlights of its economy are the elaboration of steel and the wood industry, both on wide exporting booms. We were asked to design a branch of the ‘Consorcio Nacional de Seguros', National Insurance Consortium, in a corner site, in front of the only historic and antique church in Concepción, whose façade had been unfortunately reconstructed after an earthquake. Furthermore, it had a front fenced square that impoverished its quality and public character.

A first version was carried out. It consisted in a triangular building with the vertical circulation organized in a glazed tower in the south. Because the triangular building spun the first two floors in a double height space, a square was created, which joined to the church's square, creating an environment of urban interest. In turn, the double point of the corner cantilever emphasized the building presence from the busy San Martin Street. The building was clad in copper. The glazed sectors had a ‘double skin' with climbing plants on the North and West sides. This solution was eliminated for being expensive.

A simpler and more rectangular proposal was developed. The building also withdraws on the west to visually enlarge the square, which passes by the street, joining the old church to the new building. A interesting public space would be added to Concepción.

Text description provided by the architects. The Arc House is a private residence designed for a couple and their two big dogs.The site is under a flight path to the local airport and close to a train track. We felt that by using an industrial building technology, an airplane hangar, we would transcend the perceived limitations of such proximities. Further, we were all seduced by the idea of a large column-less self-supporting canopy that enclosed all the public spaces of the house -cost effectively.
Save this picture!
The challenge was to find a scale for the arch that would transform this building system into an intimate and enclosed space. At a radius of 39’ with a peak ceiling height of 16’, we felt the building would be small enough to feel comfortable and yet have a sense of largeness associated with its uninterrupted ceiling curve.The arch contains the living, dining and kitchen areas in an open plan.

The entry canopy to the arch and a few other components within it are at a height of 7’, creating a touchable lower plane within the larger structure. To allow the client flexibility to add future bedrooms, we decided to house them in a flat- roofed section, in the rear, that is made of structural insulated panels (SIPS).

The lower level houses an office, a sitting room, a garage and work out areas; part of the lower level opens to a courtyard that allows cool air circulation and a distinctly private outdoor space.

By splicing the house into the landscape, we were able to transform the flat site into one with multiple horizons and take advantage of natural cooling and passive design.The energy usage of the house is significantly less than a typical house of this size; due to both the arc shape and materials used.SIP panels, high-thermal windows, closed-cell foam insulation and a metal roof were chiefly used while the use of conventional lumber was limited to interior framing and the exterior cedar siding only.

Text description provided by the architects. A group of social housing was built for local families in the traditional resort town of Zapallar, in the Central Coast of Chile. The dwellings are located on the eastern side of the Route F 30 - E that unites various villages near the Pacific. The new houses and the town are installed on small hills on different sides of the road. Besides in its crossing point the route is elevated and curved, complicating the visibility of the pedestrians. This was very dangerous, especially for students and housekeepers that travel between both sides during the day and at night. For this reason, we were asked to design a footbridge that avoided the problem. The bridge would also serve to transfer water pipes, electricity, etc. from one side to another.Given the bay with boats on the beach, the bridge was projected alluding to them, in laminated wood.  It is simply supported. Although it has the cross form of a rowboat, it corresponds to an inverted arch, triangular and longitudinally arched, which reduces the deformations and favors the structure. It has a mother beam in the lower part, that resists the inflection. Nevertheless the deformations are controlled for an assembly among this master beam, the two secondary beams parallel to this, located on a side, and the begun.  The interior elements are in compression or in tension, and the shear in the support is taken by the assembly of structural elements that arrive to this.

The "frames" were elevated to maintain the metallic railings, the drainpipes with Led lights and, also, the metallic netting, avoiding eventual stone throwing toward vehicles.  All the materials were untidy in their natural color.

By external motives to the architect the bridge was displaced some 50mts. from its original location in the zenith of the elevation of the road. Also, the ramps and pedestrian access roads were not carried out according to the plans of architecture.

Anyway the bridge offers different interpretations. It can be seen as an inverted boat of the bay, like a beauty queen tiara, or as arch of access to the town, etc.

Miele wanted Kokaistudios to design a new, innovative and challenging concept for the showroom. Not a standard home, but a living space, where the focus is on the experience more than on the products, on the scent of perfectly washed clothes, on the taste of a freshly brewed coffee or on the touch of a clean, healthy carpet.

Kokaistudios decided to design one large multi-use box, within the light grey marmorino walls, detached from the ceiling and the floor in the respect of the heritage villa, a possible interpretation of a future home, where all the appliances are hidden or concealed. 
Save this picture!
Starting from the entrance lobby, where the original wood ceiling has been carefully restored, the client’s experience will be a journey around, in and out this object, following the senses, discovering and testing Miele’s appliances. The box, finished with elegant and innovative soft-touch paint, can transform itself becoming a futuristic kitchen, a feminine bedroom, a living room or a masculine studio. The most precious Miele’s collection, the gold series, will be kept in the original restored vault of the villa.

Then the client’s experience will continue in the back corridor and up to the stone staircase, the journey through the Miele’s 112 years long history, the heritage walk. From the first washing machine, across appliances, logos and old pictures of the different decades, to the latest and most innovative products. On the third floor the client will welcome in an impressive high-ceilinged room, where the original trusses have been exposed and renovated and all the walls covered in a warm and elegant red marmorino. In this multifunctional space will be hosted private dinners, cooked by the best chefs on the open kitchen fully accessorized with Miele’s appliances, cooking classes, designer’s forums and also fashion shows.

The 5.5 meters long marble counter, surrounded by fridges and wine fridges, will have a huge mirror in the back that can automatically move up exposing a wall of Miele appliances. On the other side of the room, the space will be warmed up by an ecological innovative fire place. At the end of corridor the journey ends in the future kitchen. In this futuristic space will be periodically displayed the future products, the ones still not on the market. This challenging and unique project represents perfectly Miele core values and it’ll be a manifesto for the future development of the company in China.

Not a standard home, but a living space, where the focus is on the experience more than on the products, on the scent of perfectly washed clothes, on the taste of a freshly brewed coffee or on the touch of a clean, healthy carpet.Kokaistudios decided to design one large multi-use box, within the light grey marmorino walls, detached from the ceiling and the floor in the respect of the heritage villa, a possible interpretation of a future home, where all the appliances are hidden or concealed.

Text description provided by the architects. The New World Center, part of the New World Symphony America’s Orchestral Academy, opened its doors this week. Located in the heart of Miami Beach, the music education and performance facility is the first purpose-built home for the New World Symphony founded by artistic director Michael Tilson Thomas.In terms of design the building's exterior portrays a quiet, almost tamed Frank Gehry.  The rectangle shaped white building expresses Gehry's well known bends and folds within its interior - glimpses of which are visible through the main entrance east facade 80 foot high glass curtain wall.

The New World Center joins a wave of new architecture and design in Miami. Playing host to the most important art show in the United States, Art Basel | Miami Beach, and the 2010 National AIA Convention, Miami has been focusing its efforts on developing a new vibrant city center. Just down the street from the New World Center resides 1111 Lincoln Road designed by Herzog & de Meuron, completed last year. Currently Herzog & de Meuron are also working on the expansion for the Miami Art Museum.Miami Beach SoundScape, the public event space designed by the Dutch landscape architecture firm West 8, is located to the east of the New World Center and to the west of the new building is Pennsylvania Avenue Garage, a new 550-car parking structure designed by Gehry Partners, LLP.

New World Symphony, America’s Orchestral Academy, marks a new era for classical music with the inauguration of the institution’s first purpose-built home, an extraordinary new facility in the center of Miami Beach. Designed by Frank Gehry in close collaboration with the New World Symphony’s founder and artistic director Michael Tilson Thomas, New World Center opens up exciting new possibilities in the way music is taught, presented and experienced and dramatically advances New World Symphony’s mission to provide exceptional professional training for the gifted young music school graduates who are its Fellows.“The opening of this extraordinary building is the beginning of a wonderful adventure and exploration,” said Michael Tilson Thomas. ”Not only are we marking a new era for this organization and giving our musicians an unrivalled facility in which to learn and achieve their potential, but we are also inviting everyone to experience classical music in a new kind of space—one that is designed to engage and to energize, and that will move people from around the world to think about music in new ways.”

At the heart of New World Center is a flexible and technologically sophisticated 756-seat performance hall, featuring large acoustically reflective “sails” that surround the audience with sound and also serve as video projection surfaces. Directly adjacent to the 100,641-square-foot building is the new Miami Beach SoundScape, a landscaped 2.5- acre public space into which New World Symphony will extend its programming. Together, the building and the public space create a dynamic new city center and a geographical “heart” from which civic, cultural, recreational, tourist and leisurely activity will radiate.

Six days of opening festivities will showcase the new building’s remarkable capabilities. Events include the world premiere of a commissioned work for orchestra by acclaimed composer Thomas Adès; video projections within the performance hall, including a new work by filmmaker Tal Rosner and the world premiere of a series of animations developed in collaboration with the University of Southern California (alma mater of Michael Tilson Thomas and Frank Gehry) and its School of Cinematic Arts; outdoor video projections of a new work by Tal Rosner and digital artist C.E.B. Reas; an outdoor wallcastTM of a live concert; the introduction of new concertformats designed to engage and broaden audiences; an architecture symposium; live outdoor entertainment; and fireworks. Frank Gehry stated, “I am very proud of this building, which results from a close working relationship with my lifelong friend Michael Tilson Thomas and brings to life his dream for New World Symphony and the entire world of classical music. I hope the spirit of creative engagement that Michael and I have enjoyed will live on in the building’s spaces. They are designed to encourage young musicians, their mentors and their audiences to try new things, interact in new ways and remain open to new experiences.”

The need to build on a single floor, adjoining the existing structure, without altering the form of the plot of land through significant and costly earthmoving works, led us to design a building in the shape of a ribbon that breaks away in part from the natural terrain, before turning back in a loop against the slope of the land.

Text description provided by the architects. The project, which included medical offices and consultation rooms, called for the creation of two separate divisions, each to be established on its own floor. Sixteen parking spaces were requested in the basement, along with a boiler, and space for technical and archival premises.

To achieve a volume of adequate urban proportion, capable of strengthening the islet’s corner, and given the smallness of the basement, we built a partial third floor at an angle, in which the technical and archival premises were placed. Rather than treating it as a uniformly assembled mass, we followed, in the cutting of the roof, the principle of the blueprints that called for a “snail” organization of the various offices. This principle is supported by the presence of recesses in the roof, which allow it to adapt to variations in height.

The Kunsthaus Bregenz has two main principles to their permanent collection: archives of art architecture and a collection of Contemporary art, which complements the changing exhibition spaces. The museum strives to be the intersection of art and architecture that opens itself to culture and international influence."The art museum stands in the light of Lake Constance. It is made of glass and steel and a cast concrete stone mass which endows the interior of the building with texture and spatial composition. From the outside, the building looks like a lamp. It absorbs the changing light of the sky, the haze of the lake, it reflects light and colour and gives an intimation of its inner life according to the angle of vision, the daylight and the weather."  - Peter Zumthor

The minimalist structure stands as a light box that absorbs, reflects, and filters light across the façade and throughout the building.  The facades etched, translucent glass glows as it is illuminated by the sunlight, or the interior lighting, becoming a dynamic part of the building as it reacts differently according to the light, time of day, weather, and the surrounding context.

The light that is captured by the glass façade gets filtered through a light plenum that catches and distributes the light through the gallery spaces.  The plenum creates atmospheric conditions within the gallery spaces that have a conditional relationship with the exterior, and vice versa.

The interior of the museum complements the exterior simplicity and minimalist aesthetic.  The gallery spaces are composed of materials that are minimal in design, but highly effectual in detail and atmospheric conditions.  The walls and floor are made of polished concrete, and the ceiling, that filters the light from the plenum, is made of frosted glass.  The basic materials of the interior give the gallery spaces a stark, cold feeling that works to accommodate the art working in the space.  When the light enters through the plenum, the polished concrete seems to dematerialize and wash away allowing for the closed off galleries to become flooded with light.

The interior works as a fusion between art and architecture that although extremely different in materiality and composition, the mixture of combination of diffused natural light and the neutral material palette come together cohesively as a contemporary art museum where art nor architecture overshadow the other.

The buildings structure is minimalist and reductive in the sense that only three walls support the museum and all of its floor plates.  The three concrete walls enclose the gallery spaces and section off the circulation spaces to the perimeter of the building creating a building of seclusion and openness all in one.

These can accommodate infrastructural properties: storage, restrooms and staff areas. But the poches are also set to host public facilities such as small flexible workshop spaces and computer labs. This brings integration to all functions without detaching, staff and service areas from the public accessible areas. Skin: By wrapping of the main cone volumes, poches – minor spaces – are created.

The light falling along the walls, adds flexibility so objects can be randomly placed in the space. The amount of light can be varied by means of blinds, and if desired, the skylight in the chimneys may be replaced by spotlight directed on a single object or a group of items of the exhibition and since the light falls along the walls, adding the possibility of placing an object anywhere in the room. Because of these “non-spacious” attributes of the building the events and exhibitions will be the constituent for the creation of space.

The hair acts as an organic machine, where energy is “derived” trough kinetic energy producing light. The light is both responding to underlying formal features, and underlining the character of the building seen from a distance. At night, light permeates through the crevices of the enclosure shells.

The tortoise embodies a sense of history, ancestry, preservation, and wisdom. With history and education as the heart of MoCCA’s mission, the library, classrooms, and gallery spaces become the body of the museum. It is then lifted off the ground not only to provide communal space at the street level, but to elevate the contents to a more dynamic position.

These screens not only filter the daylight to avoid contact with the art, they allow the programs to be highly visible from the street and easily accessible to the public. As one enters the museum, a central spine allows the visitor to take their time and travel upward through the underbelly of the museum, towards the featured exhibition space and roof garden.

The concept originates from a series of bubble quotes used in comics, which, in this design, is used to display the programs of the Museum. The dynamic and playful interior space, created by the bubble quotes shapes, generates an engaging, fun visitor’s experience, which allows them to observe different activities happening at the same time. Moreover, these bubble quotes are connected by a vertical helix ramp at the center of the building. And to make the experience even more amusing, slides are provided as a shortcut from one space to another. With the unique figure that carries a mission to display as well as promote comic and cartoon art, this museum will be the new icon for lower east side area of Manhattan.

The aggressive aesthetic was inspired by the comic illustration technique for expressing motion. Streaks were “drawn” onto the exterior to illustrate, as in comics and cartoons, a striking visual motion toward the street. The angle at which the museum is “flying” is 21 degrees, which expresses the Lower East Side street grid angle, desirable stadium seating angle, and is a compatible angle with Tschumi’s Blue Condos across Delancey Street.

The street “energies” are embodied in the yellow acrylic circulation core, which is intended to be flying from Delancey Street and into the museum. The museum, which is visually on a collision course for Delancey Street, is penetrated by the circulation core. This dynamic is a comic expression of the way almost every building is experienced: penetrating the building mass from the street via a circulation system.

Collaborative work between artist and architect, Pedestrian Strands is a quasi-permanent installation on four bridges in downtown Kansas City, Missouri. Renovating the decks of these bridges was intended to extend the usefulness of the bridges for another ten years, after which full replacement will be required and the re-application of Pedestrian Strands reconsidered. At the insistence of the Downtown Council and the Crossroads Community Association, these renovations were to include increased attention to the pedestrian experience.Collaborative work between artist and architect, Pedestrian Strands is a quasi-permanent installation on four bridges in downtown Kansas City, Missouri.

Furthermore, the project had to occur within the space typically reserved for a bridge guardrail. All elements of the project required approval from both the Public Works Department of Kansas City and the Missouri Department of Transportation.

It is a careful composition of chain link fencing, glass panels and LED light fixtures. Existing site conditions – highway signs, cars, buildings from both sides of the highway – are folded into the overall composition. No particular view is preferenced over another.

My first trip to China was in 1988. Ironically, this was the same year sweeping land reforms were instituted by the government. It was very simple, really. It was like a massive stimulus package. Though, at the time, the full ramifications of these policies were not completely understood. My first trip to China was in 1988. Ironically, this was the same year sweeping land reforms were instituted by the government. It was very simple, really. It was like a massive stimulus package. Though, at the time, the full ramifications of these policies were not completely understood.Basically, the laws governing land management were altered. All land was (and still is) state-owned. There is no private property in China. 1949 erased the concept from history. Under the policy changes, which also coincided with other dramatic economic reforms, land use rights could be traded on a quasi-private real-estate market.

Shocking, I know. Architecture was simply the background, the environmental equivalent to muzak. I was conscious of it, but in a more detached, impersonal way, and without the need to exercise any architectural power over my surroundings. Another shocking thing about that time: I didn’t have the need to filter everything trough the narrative of Architecture.

These smaller administrative bodies then decided how to utilize their leased land. All citizens were granted state-run housing. In the cities, this meant you had a concrete flat. This system was known as the iron rice bowl and, amongst those old enough to remember, there is no shortage of nostalgia for it.

It’s the same concrete, boxy, walk-up design seen throughout the developing world and especially in the former Soviet bloc. If it hasn’t been done already, someone should get a grant and go and document all these buildings around the world. That would keep you busy for a while.

These buildings were functional, utilitarian, designed to be flexible, mass-produced (pre-fab concrete panels) and easy to maintain. All the pipes ran on the exterior so they looked like giant radiators. In fact, they were heated by hot water pumped from coal-fired boiler stations and power plants. At one time in China, this was architecture. These buildings were functional, utilitarian, designed to be flexible, mass-produced (pre-fab concrete panels) and easy to maintain.

In fact, they were heated by hot water pumped from coal-fired boiler stations and power plants.These buildings were usually no more than five storeys max so they wouldn’t need elevators. They often had communal restrooms and cooking areas. The windows consisted of rudimentary wood frames (always painted green for some reason) and paper-thin panes of glass. There was no insulation, save the concrete. These buildings were usually no more than five storeys max so they wouldn’t need elevators. They often had communal restrooms and cooking areas.

One winter morning a dump truck backed up to the front door and unloaded a mountain of coal so large it reached the second floor and covered the steps. By this time, I had been living in China for a few months so this didn’t shock me at all. This was how I was going to take hot showers and fill my hot water thermos. I grabbed a shovel and helped the watchman clear a path. Black snow. I lived in a building like this.

People for the most part bicycled from one concrete building to the next. Women often rode side-saddle on the package rack over the rear wheel, holding onto the thin waist of boyfriend or husband. Sometimes they didn’t hold on at all and just languidly sat on the back as the bicycle weaved through the current of the street. I used to drift around on my bike, holding my camera up and snapping photos. Before Architecture, there were just thousands of building like this. There were very few cars.

The streets were tree-lined, wide and mostly filled with cyclists, tractors that belched plumes of black or weirdly orange smoke, and accordion buses. While biking, you quickly learned to keep to the outside of buses so as not to get jammed up by the throngs of people running to push their way into them.

The streets would be so empty at night that they were like pedestrian promenades. People used to steel man-hole covers to melt down. This would usually happen at night, under faint orange street lamps and other areas of almost total darkness. The sounds you would hear at night were of bicycles hissing by with the occasional brr-ing, brr-ing of their bells and the sound of men hacking and spitting coal dust. I found myself doing this same reprehensible act after a few months. I used to see how far I could make the black phlegm ball fly.

It was so utterly different from the environments I had come from. Today, China is still very different, but the logic and feel of its built environments are now more recognizable and predictable. China used to be less a spectacle of material and cultural transformation and more just a foreign place of novelty, difference, and the unexpected.

Every year it comes, but it never changes anything. It is the fifth season, a phase of the environment.

Of course, if you have ever lived through a Beijing sand storm you would know that it is quite real. Nevertheless, when the sand is gone nothing has really changed and it is easily forgotten.

It may be easier to say what it was, but now it’s just everything imaginable. Steven Holl’s watercolors of imagined buildings get built in China. If anybody is going to build one of Xefirotarch’s designs it will be in China before it even gets a nod of consideration anywhere else.

It’s the old, informal stuff that stands out. Perhaps this is partly true because when westerners travel to China they are looking for certain things that fit their image of “China.” Usually this is something more “traditional” or improvisational—old and restored to grandeur or new and somewhat messed up, funky. China has always been where we go to find something else, something Other. There is so much Architecture of one type or another that it simply begins to vanish before you.

For many members of urban society, the real is defined by constant change that also encompasses the radical transformation of their material environments. There is a sense that nothing is fixed, nothing is stable. Cab drivers are often berated for not knowing their way around, but nobody really knows their way around anymore—at least geographically. Maps are useless. Now, whenever I return to China, I try to find my way, just like everyone else. Right now, the very definition of what is real in China is unstable.

Focusing on projecting new living conditions circa 2085 in the Netherlands, “A Wonderful World” master class with Wiel Arets at the Berlage Institute Postgraduate Research Laboratory, challenged participants to rethink the proposition of living in a metropolis, high-rise building. Researching and redefining the map of the world, all of the continents were being projected to be within a 288 minute radius with a maximum travel distance of 72 minutes between continents. The basic question put forward: How will the city develop within our extremely exciting, complex, but shrinking world?Focusing on projecting new living conditions circa 2085 in the Netherlands, “A Wonderful World” master class with Wiel Arets at the Berlage Institute Postgraduate Research Laboratory, challenged participants to rethink the proposition of living in a metropolis, high-rise building.

The great revolutions of humanity correspond not only to production and technology but the very mentality of space–spatial revolutions. Despite this continuous realignment of space, a general dichotomy arises that serves as a basis for architecture, the city and our lives in them: indoors and outdoors.

The great revolutions of humanity correspond not only to production and technology but the very mentality of space–spatial revolutions. Despite this continuous realignment of space, a general dichotomy arises that serves as a basis for architecture, the city and our lives in them: indoors and outdoors.Prior to 10,000 BCE, humans built campfires and sought out food and pleasance in the outdoors. This ancient culture describes a sort of “state of nature,” before introducing the dichotomy of indoors and outdoors for our lives. The first spatial revolution corresponds to the Agricultural Revolution. Representing the first large leap into the sedentary, our ancestors saw this as an escape from the wild into civilization, a shift from the outdoors into the indoors. The second spatial revolution corresponds to the Industrial Revolution. From then on, we understand the city as a interior, a congested closed place, that lacks the fresh air, wildlife and “wellness” that the apparent “natural” landscape offered. The third spatial revolution corresponds to the 20th century and is well-described in Reyner Banham’s essay, “A home is not a house,” where we become subject to the “virtual.” The fundamental relationships of the indoors, outdoors, climate and geography, are obliterated, as we watch nature shows on TV and enjoy 21C temperature year-round.

One claim is the constant anticipation, related to stimulation of dopamine, of incoming e-mails and SMSs uses up brain power, leaving people unable to “be fully in the moment” and deprived of “downtime.” The electromagnetic radiation itself may also have a harmful effect on the body.

Our project therefore is based in the premise that the new outdoors is precisely outside of the ubiquitous and pervasive wireless dimension, a sort of inversion of conventional understanding, a heterotopic carte blanche, unshackled from mobile devices.

Surface areas, floating platforms in the open air, within the new city are parametrically organized, efficiently providing for all programs. Whereas the outdoors was traditionally designated by “mother nature,” and the indoors was conceived by man, the inverse happens in the future–the outdoors is designed by man and the indoors is planned by computation. Just as we heard of wi-fi hotspots by word-of-mouth in the 1990s, in the 2080s the new outdoors becomes a discussed, socially activated realm.

Thus, we invert this relationship and allow the new indoors to reign, by radicalizing the architecture material palette and disintegrating building components into space and climate. On one hand, the surface areas of the city reflect electromagnetic signals like a Hall of Mirrors, providing complete coverage of the wireless connectivity. On the other hand, the envelope of the new outdoors is characterized by new materiality that nullifies wi-fi signals.

Specifically, the new outdoors is a logic to “un-plug” areas of the city. When the city is designed by computer and wi-fi, the spatial agency people have is to subtract, to “un-plug” area, and create outdoors spaces from the “e-space.” This is achieved by enveloping and joining together a quantity of the city’s surface areas.

Check out Visiondivision’s latest work – a residential extension to an old Swedish house. Expanding upon the clients’ taste in the traditional Swedish houses with mullion windows, or ‘spröjs’ in Swedish, the team set out to exploit the building component by introducing ”a huge mullion window as its main feature.” The mullion window becomes the focal point of the house as it covers the front facade and opens toward the garden that slopes toward the nearby lake.Check out Visiondivision’s latest work – a residential extension to an old Swedish house.

Succinct interventions — blowing out the southern wall; work surfaces of 4’ x 8’ white painted solid core doors; epoxy-finished, painted floors; off-the-shelf storage systems; the red line resolving the trapezoidal shape of the space; and strategic landscape design — accomplished the job for $20.00/square foot (including mechanical / electrical / data / telephone infrastructure, the garden, and the build-out of all work surfaces).

Although this space specifically houses architects, it was designed as a generic working space. It aims to simply and clearly honor the rudiments of work:• Vast work surfaces• Massive natural light• Seamless connections to the landscape and fresh air• Generous, vivid, and available storage• Clearly individuated work stations that together create a coherent, palpable groupArchitects think of architecture as process.

Upon entering the office, process and product become one - the visitor is immediately drawn into the architecture. Served and servant zones are explicitly defined and are visually calibrated to achieve complete transparency. In this way, the whole process of creation is revealed instantly upon entry.

For their latest PRAXIS, Eleven Architects/Twelve Conversations, the editors moved away from organizing the issue around a single theme to, instead, focusing on a variety of architectural aspects. The result is a rather cohesive reading, as the different ideas are fused into a continuous conversation. The issue still highlights great projects from the featured architects, yet the projects take more of a supporting role, as the real focus is the conversation that jumps from sustainability to design influences and materials to even the broader implications of design on the built environment.For their latest PRAXIS, Eleven Architects/Twelve Conversations, the editors moved away from organizing the issue around a single theme to, instead, focusing on a variety of architectural aspects.

Text description provided by the architects. This construction occupies the top of a hillside and is projected over an immense valley framed with a chain of mountains, a predominant relief in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. In the surroundings of Nova Lima – MG, where the construction was erected, a considerable part of the houses are influenced by the language of Portuguese colonial architecture and uses manual techniques of construction.

The house was projected for a young executive with a bold entrepreneur profile. Our architectonic proposal created a contemporaneous language tuned to the owner’s profile and, at the same time, it incorporated the constructive techniques and materials available in the region.  With this conceptual arrangement we were able to articulate constructive tradition to contemporaneous design and open space to a new approach of architectonic solution for local houses.

The place chosen for the house was determined by the generous native landscape in the surroundings.  In this context, space definition privileged the possibilities of relationship of house users with the exuberant natural landscape.  As for the relation House x Nature, we decided for the contrast, i.e., the radicalization of a geometric and rational design in opposition to natural organic shapes.  Therefore, the “natural order” and “cultural order” are mutually distinguished and valued.

The house was built in a land with three distinct levels. This  arrangement lead to a better use of declivity and, at the same time, great plasticity to architectonic elements.  Pure volumes receive interference from inclined columns, from discontinuous covering planes and from the red wall that crosses the house.  The reference to the Brazilian modernist architecture is maintained and nevertheless unconstructed and reorganized.

Text description provided by the architects. Royal/T is a playful collision of art gallery, café and retail shop within a 10,000 sf warehouse in Culver City, California. wHY Architecture designed the space unlike any other, playing upon traditional rules of gallery, retail and restaurant design. Rather than the ‘white box' space, existing walls remained unpainted, and undulating ribbons of ten foot high acrylic walls contain the art and retail offerings in architectural vitrines.

It is these vitrines that allow for the juxtaposition of disparate programs that yields a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Patrons can dine in close proximity to the multi-million dollar art collection, the only barrier being the hyper-clear, butt-glazed cast acrylic. Diners become voyeurs and participants in the architectural fusion of pop-culture and high-end design. Like a private club, the Washington Boulevard entrance is covered in faux boxwood, with only the Royal/T crown logo in hot pink neon.

Inspired by the Maid Cafés in Tokyo's Akihabara district, the highly conceptualized space of Royal/T reflects the interior realm of fantasy that strongly influences the artists included in owner Sue Hancock's private collection. Recontextualizing the underground ‘okaku' (geek) culture of Japan that celebrated ‘cosplay' (costume play), the café servers dress in maid uniforms with a Lolita-esque touch. The look-but-don't-touch theme continues with the art and retail offerings contained within the acrylic vitrines. Even the requisite café ceiling is acrylic, allowing the existing bowstring trusses to remain visible.

Standing in the old mining and industrial city of Firminy, the Church of Firminy was one of a set of community buildings designed by Le Corbusier, among these are an Olympic stadium, youth club and cultural center, standard housing complex, and finally Unite-d'Habitation.

Recognizing the small congregation of the city, the architect wanted to embrace and celebrate the miners and steel workers that produced most of the goods of the area, which explains his use of concrete. He hoped that this material would also give him control over the volume and spaces in his overall goal of giving light a true meaning.

As can be expected by the architect, he fused many of his core architectural ideas from previous projects into his newer design, while also leaving room to be inspired by religion.

He wanted to create a setting that established a place for spiritual enrichment on a modest scale. About this, Le Corbusier stated that the space must be "vast so that the heart may feel at ease, and high so that prayers may breathe in it."

Instead, these five projects promote an attitude that looks at technology as a uniquely human means of expression, through which the “natural”—in its broadest sense—can be engaged and made more visible.

More event description after the break.In contrast, Souper Green features five architectural propositions that explore the way that technology—reviled by many as the source of the environmental problem and revered by others as its potential solution—can promote and enhance a far more constructive engagement between architecture and the environment. This “souped up” approach to green architecture is achieved by leveraging the expressive potential of a meaner, greener technology in order to produce architecture that is not only environmentally responsible by quantifiable measures, but which also critically and positively promotes more expressive, exuberant, rad, boss, and totally stoked green experiences.

Collectively this group represents a vision that is both unique and uniquely consistent within the discipline of architecture, but one that is also rich and nuanced. The work that they have produced for this exhibition capitalizes on their collective expertise, as well as their proven unwillingness to play it safe. While other architects have so far elected to only timidly engage the environmental crisis, the work in the Souper Green exhibition demonstrates the superlative approach to greenness that architecture should take, and leaves all previous efforts at green architecture in the dust.The SOUPERgreen exhibition features newly completed projects by Doug Jackson, Wes Jones, Aryan Omar, Steven Purvis, and Randolph Ruiz—five architects and designers who have each produced widely publicized and celebrated work renowned for its emphasis on the expressive and transformative potential of technology.

Text description provided by the architects. As an interruption of Phoenix's Jeffersonian grid and "downtown" of glass box and faux adobe, the new federal building is a gravitational point of interest and anchor for the sprawling city of Phoenix.  The 500,000 square-foot building with six stories and underground parking is sited on two central city blocks between the governmental and business districts.

The building's exterior massing harmonizes with the indigenous, rectilinear geometry of its context, but the focus is a massive atrium lobby which offers occupants and visitors a naturally acclimatized public space of outdoor proportions.

Ground Floor, Courtesy of Richard Meier & Partners Architects
An interior, urban landscape has been designed into the void:  the ceremonial, glass-clad Special Proceedings Court rises as a cylindrical building volume; while the southern flank of the atrium features a street-like facade of multiple levels with entries to various offices, agencies and courtrooms.The building's diverse program, including special security provisions, is clarified by a straight-forward organization:  an L-shaped block, fronted on the western and southern limits of the site, contains federal offices; facilities such as child care, credit union, press room, library and judges' chambers with the capacity for nineteen District Courts and four Magistrate Courts.  A cafeteria on the second floor looks onto a garden on the western side of the site.

Passively cooled by natural convection currents and a water-misting system, the atrium provides energy efficient space that is comfortable for public gatherings.

The phenomenon of adiabatic cooling - through evaporation rather than heat exchange - is used to attain a drop in air temperature without a significant expenditure of energy.  Even on the hottest summer days, the temperature in the hall can be lowered from between 15 degrees to 20 degrees Fahrenheit, and the movement of air at occupied levels enhances the sensation of comfort.Solar orientation and facade articulation reinforce the design intentions:  the atrium faces north, receiving the benefits of reflected light through a tessellated curtain wall of transparent and frit glass. 
Save this picture!
The facade is given additional dimension by its structural framework: T-profile steel columns, which raise the full height of the building, mullions that project in relief, and shadowbox techniques.  The air-conditioned office and courtroom block receives limited southern light through a more opaque, louvered facade.

The 500,000 square-foot building with six stories and underground parking is sited on two central city blocks between the governmental and business districts.The building's exterior massing harmonizes with the indigenous, rectilinear geometry of its context, but the focus is a massive atrium lobby which offers occupants and visitors a naturally acclimatized public space of outdoor proportions. The building's exterior massing harmonizes with the indigenous, rectilinear geometry of its context, but the focus is a massive atrium lobby which offers occupants and visitors a naturally acclimatized public space of outdoor proportions. An interior, urban landscape has been designed into the void:  the ceremonial, glass-clad Special Proceedings Court rises as a cylindrical building volume; while the southern flank of the atrium features a street-like facade of multiple levels with entries to various offices, agencies and courtrooms.An interior, urban landscape has been designed into the void:  the ceremonial, glass-clad Special Proceedings Court rises as a cylindrical building volume; while the southern flank of the atrium features a street-like facade of multiple levels with entries to various offices, agencies and courtrooms.The building's diverse program, including special security provisions, is clarified by a straight-forward organization:  an L-shaped block, fronted on the western and southern limits of the site, contains federal offices; facilities such as child care, credit union, press room, library and judges' chambers with the capacity for nineteen District Courts and four Magistrate Courts.  A cafeteria on the second floor looks onto a garden on the western side of the site.The building's diverse program, including special security provisions, is clarified by a straight-forward organization:  an L-shaped block, fronted on the western and southern limits of the site, contains federal offices; facilities such as child care, credit union, press room, library and judges' chambers with the capacity for nineteen District Courts and four Magistrate Courts.

In this prominent position, the museum’s striking design will give the city yet another landmark. In the south and east the building opens onto a spacious public plaza, shielding the adjoining residential quarters in the north from the busy roads. At the same time the museum forecourt is not only the place where visitors arrive but also somewhere the inhabitants of the neighboring districts can spend time. Trees and expanses of greenery create a natural transition and a visual dividing line between the exhibition building and the road.

Constructing a museum on Imperial Axis in Beijing, China is for us as German architects a great success and an enormous honor.”A floating roof is the Museum’s distinguishing feature The new building’s key element is a floating structure measuring 133.5 by 133.5 meters, which rises above the pedestal building at a height of around 20 meters. This roof is supported by numerous, extremely slender columns, which, based on the image of a bamboo grove, form a concentrated forest of columns. They create a spatial transition from the public road to the scien-tific exhibition area. The exhibition’s aim is to give visitors access to future technology, science, and research. The forest of columns, water basin and the slanting pedestal create an architectural topography that leads the visitors from the city into the museum’s exhibition world. The spherical edifice hous-ing the former Beijing Science Centers, (the sphere with the 3D cinema), which was well known in the city, is to be integrated in the new museum building, thereby preserving its significance and standing.

The latter section is housed in the spherical structure. Apart from the three exhibition levels 5, 6 and 7, which cover a surface area of some 40,000 square meters in the float-ing edifice, what is known as the “Science Cloud”, the museum, which has a total surface area 65,240 square meters, also boasts the following facilities: two further sections for changing exhibitions covering a surface area of 4,960 square meters in total, rooms for museum-related educational activi-ties, an auditorium, a restaurant and a museum café, not to mention inte-grated services. The research and administration areas are located in the northern section of the pedestal.

The facades stand out for their white, thermally insulated square and rhombic aluminum panels. Various-size window openings emphasize the dynamic shape of the edifices and make the activities on the inside visible. Furthermore, LED lighting in the exhibition area ensures reduced electricity consumption. The water ba-sins humidify and cool the air naturally.

Text description provided by the architects. The harbour of Scheveningen was originally a fishing harbour. In the course of time fishery declined in importance and so did the companies. As a result, many old warehouses in the Second Harbour became redundant and are now due for demolition. At the same time, there is a large demand for building ground in this area. By renovating the warehouses and placing steel penthouses on their rooftops, the harbour is given a new lease of life. 
Save this picture!
These projects in Scheveningen led to the discussion about rooftop housing (sky borne buildings) in Europe. The themes developed here in connection with type, technology and impact on urban design were later elaborated in several other projects. The Harbour View penthouse designed 14 years ago by Archipelontwerpers, was the first step towards rooftop housing. The point of reference for this design was the presence of several robust warehouses with steel cooling plants on the roof. A two-storey, lightweight steel penthouse has been constructed on top of a brick base consisting of two structures that face one another (the socle). The construction comprises a frame of hot-rolled sections with a lightweight panel filling.

plan 01
The penthouse was to be used as a home/office and/or studio. These demands were frequently modified and expanded during the building process. The penthouse consists of a single space occupying both storeys. Rooms like the bathroom and bedroom can be partitioned off by means of sliding partitions. The demands were as follows: the residents must be able to look out from the bath over the empty space and see the sea, and once they were out of the bath they must be able to follow different routes through the house. Essential for this penthouse are the spacious terraces on different levels and the double route afforded by the two staircases. 
Save this picture!
After the penthouse had been completed, Archipelontwerpers worked on the transformation of a number of warehouses that had been declared unusable and were due for demolition. Similar steel penthouses are placed on and above these warehouses (IJsvis, Nautilus and Rokerij). The Scheveningen harbour can thus become an example of stepping-stone urban planning. The principle on which the stepping-stone strategy is based involves two aspects: 1) the formulation/identification of the theme, and 2) the transformation of the theme. It is thus not the case that themes are closed systems, like a Lego box, in which the explicit rules of play have to be taken into account in the search for variants. The reverse is in fact the case. Because various similarities are introduced into diverse projects, and are also identified as such at a certain moment, a particular theme emerges as a pattern. This theme then serves as the starting-point for new variants. 
Save this picture!
All variants also include many non-thematic aspects, variants and specific solutions, and repetition of these leads to sub themes. The themes evolve thanks to these transformations. These aspects of emergence and evolution are the major difference in approach between Bernard Tschumi’s follies for Parc de la Villette in Paris – here the red follies could be configured precisely on the green grass within the blueprint of strict rules of play – and the façades that Palladio designed for three churches beside the Canale della Giudecca in sixteenth-century Venice.

The three façades are not identical, but in orientation and in composition, colour and material they have a lot in common.

It was above Palladio’s approach that was the reference for Archipelontwerpers in developing the stepping-stone strategy in Scheveningen. It was not until after they had received commissions from two different clients, followed after a while by a third, to design penthouses on top of an old warehouse that the opportunity spontaneously arose of playing a game of references, by which a certain theme was introduced, though all of this took place without the explicit formulation of any rules beforehand. So the stepping-stone strategy is a game of references under construction rather than a developed system within which the rules of play have to be followed. Given the specific (technical) properties of every raised ground level and the at times highly personal preferences regarding the rooftop home, such tight rules would be undesirable.

It is thus not the case that themes are closed systems, like a Lego box, in which the explicit rules of play have to be taken into account in the search for variants. The reverse is in fact the case. Because various similarities are introduced into diverse projects, and are also identified as such at a certain moment, a particular theme emerges as a pattern. This theme then serves as the starting-point for new variants.All variants also include many non-thematic aspects, variants and specific solutions, and repetition of these leads to sub themes. The themes evolve thanks to these transformations. These aspects of emergence and evolution are the major difference in approach between Bernard Tschumi’s follies for Parc de la Villette in Paris – here the red follies could be configured precisely on the green grass within the blueprint of strict rules of play – and the façades that Palladio designed for three churches beside the Canale della Giudecca in sixteenth-century Venice.

The three façades are not identical, but in orientation and in composition, colour and material they have a lot in common.It was above Palladio’s approach that was the reference for Archipelontwerpers in developing the stepping-stone strategy in Scheveningen. It was not until after they had received commissions from two different clients, followed after a while by a third, to design penthouses on top of an old warehouse that the opportunity spontaneously arose of playing a game of references, by which a certain theme was introduced, though all of this took place without the explicit formulation of any rules beforehand. So the stepping-stone strategy is a game of references under construction rather than a developed system within which the rules of play have to be followed. Given the specific (technical) properties of every raised ground level and the at times highly personal preferences regarding the rooftop home, such tight rules would be undesirable.It was above Palladio’s approach that was the reference for Archipelontwerpers in developing the stepping-stone strategy in Scheveningen.

We wanted to create a space having the capacity to transform, by its physicality, the life in a subway station.In order to achieve our goal, like surgeons we started to study and to dissect the material we were using for the installation: the cork. We wanted to identify a design concept and a very simple construction technique. We wanted to create an intimate relation between material properties and user’s physicality. Cork was reduced to a list of material properties and attributes that could interact with people: Texture, Granularity, Porosity, Acoustic insulation, Density, Thickness and finally the most important: Flexibility.

Cork was reduced to a list of material properties and attributes that could interact with people: Texture, Granularity, Porosity, Acoustic insulation, Density, Thickness and finally the most important: Flexibility.Cork is very flexible. Flexibility means elasticity and vibration. A response to touch to body pressure. Thanks to its flexibility, it was possible to shape the cork. We wanted to offer a dynamic shelter, an hammock, a space: the project was achieved by literally folding fifteen strips of cork to obtain an onion ring effect. Cork is very flexible. Flexibility means elasticity and vibration. A response to touch to body pressure. Thanks to its flexibility, it was possible to shape the cork. We wanted to offer a dynamic shelter, an hammock, a space: the project was achieved by literally folding fifteen strips of cork to obtain an onion ring effect.The onion rings were realized with different cork types and thicknesses. The installation was articulated in a series of internal paths in which babies could run, walk, climb, lay and rock. The tracks were articulated by the opening or closing of the profiles. Shape and profile transformations were obtained by literally pinching the cork with a bolt. When placed on the higher positions of the profile, the onion configuration would open up. Moving the bolt toward the ground made the shape close down. The onion rings were realized with different cork types and thicknesses.

Therefore with the form transformation the rigidity of the shape also changed. For the more open type of profile the flexibility was higher. A simple touch could activate the ring vibration by literally transforming the Onion in culls. For the more rigid shapes the vibration was limited.

People slowed down from their everyday rhythm and looked at the installation, touched it, pushed it and tested the different reactions of the onion to body pressure. Babies immediately appropriate the space. The presence of an extremely alive object, with its texture, with the oscillation of the onion rings, transformed an unfamiliar, cold space like the subway station into a lively oasis.

Text description provided by the architects. This project intersects a vernacular house typology with the site-specific conditions of this unique place: an island on Lake Huron. The location on the Great Lakes imposed complexities to the house's fabrication and construction, as well as its relationship to site. Annual cyclical change related to the change of seasons, compounded with escalating global environmental trends, cause Lake Huron's water levels to vary drastically from month-to-month, year-to-year. To adapt to this constant, dynamic change, the house floats atop a structure of steel pontoons, allowing it to fluctuate along with the lake.

Locating the house on a remote island posed another set of constraints. Using traditional construction processes would have been prohibitively expensive; the majority of costs would have been applied toward transporting building materials to the remote island. Instead, we worked with the contractor to devise a prefabrication and construction process that maximized the use of thee unique character of the site:

Lake Huron as a waterway. Construction materials were instead delivered to the contractor's fabrication shop, located on t he lake shore. The steel platform structure with incorporated pontoons was built first and towed to the lake outside the workshop. On the frozen lake, near the shore, the fabricators constructed the house.

The structure was then towed to the site and anchored. In total, between the various construction stages, the house traveled a total distance of approximately 80 km on the lake.

The formal envelope of the house experiments with the cedar siding of the vernacular home. This familiar form not only encloses the interior living space, but also enclosed exterior space as well as open voids for direct engagement with the lake. A "rainscreen" envelope of cedar strips condense to shelter interior space and expand to either filter light entering interior spaces or screen and enclose exterior spaces giving a modulated yet singular character to the house, while performing pragmatically in reducing win d load and heat gain.

Text description provided by the architects. The Place de la République is situated in a very special location within the city of Paris. The square could potentially represent one of the city’s major monuments of the 21st century.

This potential should not be wasted and the future plans for the space must be designed for the long term, and thus should be able to accommodate evolutions over time.  Today, though, this potential suffers and remains unexploited.  There are several reasons to explain why; the marked domination of traffic circulation over all other activities, the indiscernible pedestrian pathways which are parceled and static.

plan 01
Today, the quality of the Place de la République is subjected to the typology of a traffic circle.  Now it is a matter of creating a public space for pedestrians, as large as possible, and one that is directly connected to the façades along one side of the square. The square is dissymmetrical in both directions, and this form is particularly important from an environmental and climatic point of view.  This environmental approach is outlined in a few simple principles: 
Save this picture!
-Reinforce the presence of greenery and produce a unified landscape with maximum area. -Let the sun penetrate and position the pedestrian pathways in the areas that receive the most sunlight. -Let the warm summer winds penetrate for better aeration of the city and for the dilution of pollutants. -Block the uncomfortable cold winter winds.

We are proposing to create a vast public space reserved for pedestrians and cyclists, and to create a connection to the square at the north-east border.  In order to create this link, it is necessary to cut the circulation of traffic on the street Faubourg du Temple at its intersection with the street Yves Toudic, and to extend the public space up to this point.  In this way the future Place de la République would be a large free space of 2 hectares, opening onto the main boulevards.   The future Place de la République must have a sense of unity.  Unity is provided here in its spatial composition: one unified flow of movement, as well as for the work on the land.

The long edges of the home and studio face the south and north. A northern exposure is naturally cool, and deep porches on the south side shade windows from any direct sunlight. The points of the football face the higher-intensity east and west, offering very little surface area to absorb heat. The long edges of the home and studio face the south and north.

Although I’ve always loved sustainable design, I kind of woke up and said, ‘What the heck am I doing? I have a golden opportunity to build one last home, and I’m building the proverbial architect’s house like everybody else?

And went on from there.He added a third building, a greenhouse in the clearing, which plays a key role in the home’s net zero status. As a net zero home, the Zona property consumes no more power than it produces. The greenhouse carries solar photovoltaic panels that can produce 6.5 kwH. A special electric meter enables the compound to sell electricity back to the grid during sunny spells and borrow from the grid when sunlight is scarce. “We could go completely off the grid,” Zona explains, “but batteries are not yet efficient enough to economically store solar-based electricity.” He added a third building, a greenhouse in the clearing, which plays a key role in the home’s net zero status.

It draws 70 degree F water from an aquifer 300 feet below ground, runs the cool water through a heat exchanger to blow 55 degree F air, then returns the water to the aquifer.

The cladding – surprisingly attractive vertical corrugated metal – reflects, rather than absorbs, sunlight.“To have net zero home, you have to spend a lot of time thinking about every one of these decisions,” says Zona. “If you don’t site the home correctly in the first place, it’s an uphill battle all the way. ArchiCAD helped us orient the buildings and panels for both protection from the sun’s heat and maximum capture of the sun’s electrical potential. Every electrical device that goes into the home – pumps, fans, lights, and appliances – needs to be analyzed to ensure you don’t exceed 6.5 kwH. You need to consider: How much energy does this device consume? How long does it run? And how do you capture the benefits with techniques like efficient insulation? You need to end up with a surplus instead of a deficit.” “To have net zero home, you have to spend a lot of time thinking about every one of these decisions,” says Zona. “If you don’t site the home correctly in the first place, it’s an uphill battle all the way.

In addition to the judicious reuse of water, all materials are locally sourced, and all wood scrap from building the home is being recycled into new boards.

The only way you can do it is with 3D BIM software like ArchiCAD. You can walk though the building and see how dramatic these spaces really are. You can understand the uniquely shaped spaces, including the thermal qualities of volumes two stories deep. You can experiment with different materials, colors, textures, and furniture placements inside and out. I’m treading new ground with these curved walls, and I wanted to see how they’d look and feel before I opened the bank account on construction.” “I mean, how are you going draw the inside of a football with a 2D software and have any kind of accuracy?” Zona asks. “We probably never would have finished the design.

Completed in 1963, Scharoun’s organic and futuristic aesthetic interpretation for the concert was a replacement for the previous Philharmonic that was destroyed in WWII.

Scharoun’s design was fairly straightforward that focused on placing music at the center of his design, both conceptually and physically. From the center, the music would be amplified and filtered throughout the auditorium.

Hans Scharoun’s work is not widely recognized outside of his design of the Berlin Philharmonic concert hall. As an architect, Scharoun was a main proponent of organic architecture whose modern architectural works strive to create a balance and harmony between nature and architecture. For the Berlin Philharmonic, the built form establishes a balance and harmony with the music contained within.

The Berlin Philharmonic’s program is very direct and simplistic requiring two music halls: a main auditorium that seats approximately 2,500 people, as well as a smaller Chamber music hall that would seat around 1,200 people; however, it’s not the program that makes this project interesting, but it is what Scharoun does spatially with the program that creates such a dynamic presence.

In the main auditorium, the stage is located at the center of the hall with the seating arranged around the stage through a series of offset terraces that were positioned for optimal acoustic performance.  In section, the auditorium appears as a concave fish bowl that projects the music in every direction.  The ceiling angles and drapes dramatically over the auditorium space capturing and projecting the sound in a rhythmic fashion.

Although the building is programmatically simple, formally the Berlin Philharmonic is complex in that the expressive interior spaces are reflected on the exterior of the building. The interior’s draping and angular composition are carried into the formal design of each halls volume. The angles and the swooping tent-like structure create a playful yet contained aesthetic that compliments the interior spatial conditions.

The exteriors dynamic façades compliment and establish a relationship with the Berlin’s Tiergarten, which is located immediately to the north of the Philharmonic. The angled and curvy facades mimic the “soft” aesthetic of the forested landscape. The facades yellow hued metal material maintains an earthy balance of landscape, color and form.

The Berlin Philharmonic may be Hans Scharoun’s most well known project, but it is a testament to the aims of organic architecture that establishes a harmony that mends concept, program, and context of music, the Tiergarten, and the discipline of architecture.

We accommodated the program in a compact, two-story structure that essentially extends to the buildable limits of the property but reserves some space for private outdoor uses.  The garage, accessed via an open motor court, can double as a photographic studio.

Guests enter from the street under a covered porch that leads to a double- height entry that is illuminated from above. The space compresses just before entering the next double-height volume of the living room. This space is adjoined by the dining space and kitchen. The master bath, dining space and living space are arranged enfilade about a centerline that leads through a double-height window wall to a sculpture garden and the park beyond. The guest suite above dining space is organized about this same axis and has its own view to the park and waterway.

The master suite adjoins a walled terrace containing a spa and fireplace. With the sliding panels open these spaces can be used as one. The powder bath is an exquisite space best explained by the images contained herein.

Located in Camaçari – Bahia – Brazil, the HOUSE CARQUEIJA is about 260,00 sqm in a 1.400,00 sqm site, with a reduced program, and no unused spaces, the house is intended to be more site sensitive, emphasize the outside life, and provide functional and comfortable living spaces. With a simple and efficient plan, it is a ground floor house with 2 rooms, a chapel and a large and flexible social area, which integrate living, dining and tv room in a open space, linked to the outside area through a porch.

Text description provided by the architects. The house in Melides, on the southern Alentejo Coast, by Pedro Reis, represents the desire for a holiday house as a getaway from the bustle of a big city. The client made the unusual decision to have an architectural competition between three distinct ateliers, allowing a choice from a wider range of possible solutions. This winning proposal presents a reading of the “drama” of the natural countryside, building it on top of a steep hill relatively protected by the surrounding “rugged topography”.

Inhabiting this site means “founding a place” by means of a “strong geometric imprint”, achieved by two volumes overlapping in the shape of a “cross”. The aim of this dialectic strategy is not just to reduce the “scale and presence” of the construction, but also to “split” the programme into two areas, one more “exuberant” and exposed and the other more “intimate” and contained. If the light upper volume recalls the synthetic image of the modern house, with large glass areas open to the scenic countryside, the “anchored” lower volume, clad with sheets of earth-coloured concrete, pre-fabricated in situ, sits on the ground, giving support and stability to the house.

In terms of programmatic organisation, the “suspended” upper volume concentrates the main spaces, defining the “minimum housing unit”, while the lower volume acts as an “expansion zone”, hosting more intimate areas or service areas, allowing increased occupation. The kitchen, as the centre of the home, takes on paramount importance here, acting as the crossing-point for all movements: entering, going through the inside and moving out into the garden, with the long pergola providing shade and a water tank reflecting the pine trees, set under the house into the main bedroom. The experience of this house aims to concentrate on its essence, on being inside and out, on contemplating and lingering, highlighting a enjoyable sense of living, close to the amenities of urban life.

Text description provided by the architects. bSIDE6 is a seven story commercial workstudio building with ground floor retail space that responds to its siting at the edge of historic industrial and commercial areas by combining the economy of a Central Eastside warehouse with the precedent of an arcade district. The 38’ by 100’ site is located in an historic arcade district that was created in the 1920’s when the main east-west city arterial, East Burnside, was widened - essentially carving out and claiming the ground floor of many existing structures. The arcades allowed for a unique pedestrian life unlike any other in the city. An urban design overlay now encourages new buildings to create relationships to the historic arcade structures and to work to reduce the perceptional width of the street.

bSIDE6 explores the elemental relationship of skin and frame by utilizing an exposed post-tensioned concrete frame stretched north out over the sidewalk like an accordion. The skin stretches along with the frame and the result is interstitial spaces that create a modern arcade providing pedestrian protection and city views and light into the inhabited spaces. The vertical circulation core acts as the primary shear wall in the building and allows for most of the exterior of the building to be free for views out to the city and beyond. Studies for the skin addressed overlapping needs for light, views, shade, economy and contextual scale.

The 38’ by 100’ site is located in an historic arcade district that was created in the 1920’s when the main east-west city arterial, East Burnside, was widened - essentially carving out and claiming the ground floor of many existing structures. The arcades allowed for a unique pedestrian life unlike any other in the city. An urban design overlay now encourages new buildings to create relationships to the historic arcade structures and to work to reduce the perceptional width of the street.bSIDE6 explores the elemental relationship of skin and frame by utilizing an exposed post-tensioned concrete frame stretched north out over the sidewalk like an accordion. The skin stretches along with the frame and the result is interstitial spaces that create a modern arcade providing pedestrian protection and city views and light into the inhabited spaces. The vertical circulation core acts as the primary shear wall in the building and allows for most of the exterior of the building to be free for views out to the city and beyond. Studies for the skin addressed overlapping needs for light, views, shade, economy and contextual scale.bSIDE6 explores the elemental relationship of skin and frame by utilizing an exposed post-tensioned concrete frame stretched north out over the sidewalk like an accordion.

Text description provided by the architects. The recent housing bubble has driven American houses to extreme sizes and exurban locations. Too often, housing value has been determined through complicated equations based on square footage and marketable features, rather than spatial, material, or environmental quality. Even in cities like Philadelphia, low-cost mortgages have helped to foster a culture of “bigger is better.”The 100K Houses were conceived as a response to this unsustainable approach to housing. Small, efficient, and super-green, the 100K Houses provide sustainable, affordable options for first-time Philadelphia homebuyers.

Completed in 1902 by Daniel Burnham, the Flatiron Building was a prime architectural design at the advent of steel skyscraper construction in the United States.  Known for its triangular design at the intersection of 5th Ave. and Broadway, the Flatiron Buildings iconic presence has transformed an entire area of Manhattan into the Flatiron District.

Manhattan has been and always will be synonymous with the overarching imposition of the grid system that defines the entire city, but each block as part of a larger collective system.  With histories of Dutch and English influence, the Commissioners’ Grid System imposed in 1811 has moments of discontinuity where streets such as Canal and Broadway cut across the grid to form residual spaces that are typically too small or difficult to develop.

The land of that the Flatiron Building now stands upon went through many hands before it became what we see today.  Often underdeveloped and in a purgatorial state shifting between owners until it was purchased by Harry S. Black, CEO of the Fuller Company  a construction firm specializing in steel and skyscraper construction  for the headquarters of the Fuller Company.  Thereafter, Black commissioned Chicago architect Daniel Burnham to design the Fuller Building later changed to the Flatiron Building due to historical site references.

Prior to Burnham’s commission of the Flatiron Building, he had been designing steel skyscrapers in Chicago, most notably the Rookery and the Reliance Building.  With the Flatiron Building, Burnham use the sites footprint to generate the base of the building; he employed a Renaissance design aesthetic with a Beaux-Arts styling that resulted in a tripartite steel skyscraper resembling a column of antiquity: base, shaft, and capital.  Similar to older precedents in architecture, the Flatiron Building appears heavy and solid, as it has a firm base before it becomes slender as it moves towards the capital.

One of the most interesting aspects of the Flatiron Building is that its design accentuates the triangular site, which is due to its acute angel at 5th and Broadway that creates the cornered condition; the northern vertex of the building is only 6.5 feet  wide.  Its narrow profile creates an interesting spatial configuration within the building where slanting walls accommodate for the narrow corner offices that open up to panoramic views of Midtown Manhattan.

During construction, New Yorker’s believed that the Flatiron’s steel frame would not stand up to the strong winds Manhattan faced.  Despite their initial conceptions, the buildings structure was design to accommodate four times the typical wind loads in order to stabilize and retain the buildings iconic triangular shape.

Text description provided by the architects. As part of the1929 International Exposition in Barcelona Spain, the Barcelona Pavilion, designed by Mies van der Rohe, was the display of architecture's modern movement to the world.  Originally named the German Pavilion, the pavilion was the face of Germany after WWI, emulating the nation’s progressively modern culture that was still rooted in its classical history. Its elegant and sleek design combined with rich natural material presented Mies’ Barcelona Pavilion as a bridge into his future career, as well as architectural modernism. More on the Barcelona Pavilion after the break.

After several architectural triumphs in Germany, Mies was commissioned to design the German Pavilion for the International Exposition in Barcelona, Spain.  The pavilion was intended to be the face of the German section that would host King Alphonso XIII of Spain and German officials at the inauguration of the exposition.  Unlike other pavilions at the exposition, Mies understood his pavilion simply as a building and nothing more, it would not house art or sculpture rather the pavilion would be a place of tranquility and escape from the exposition, in effect transforming the pavilion into an inhabitable sculpture.

Situated at the foot of the National Art Museum of Catalonia and Montjuic, the Barcelona Pavilion resides on a narrow site in a quiet tucked away corner secluded from the bustling city streets of Barcelona.  Raised on a plinth of travertine, the Barcelona Pavilion separates itself from it context create atmospheric and experiential effects that seem to occur in a vacuum that dissolves all consciousness of the surrounding city.

The pavilion’s design is based on a formulaic grid system developed by Mies that not only serves as the patterning of the travertine pavers, but it also serves as an underlying framework that the wall systems work within.  By raising the pavilion on a plinth in conjunction with the narrow profile of the site, the Barcelona Pavilion has a low horizontal orientation that is accentuated by the low flat roof that appears to float over both the interior as well as the exterior.

The low stature of the building narrows the visitor’s line of vision forcing one to adjust to the views framed by Mies.  When walking up onto the plinth, one is forced under the low roof plane that captures the adjacent outdoor court as well as the interior moments that induce circulation throughout the pavilion. The interior of the pavilion consists of offset wall places that work with the low roof plane to encourage movement, as well as activate Mies’ architectural promenade where framed views would induce movement through the narrow passage that would open into a larger volume. This cyclical process of moving throughout the pavilion sets in motion a process of discovery and rediscovery during ones experience; always offering up new perspectives and details that were previously unseen.

Every aspect of the Barcelona Pavilion has architectural significance that can be seen at the advent of modern architecture in the 20th Century; however, one of the most important aspects of the pavilion is the roof.  The low profile of the roof appears in elevation as a floating plane above the interior volume.  The appearance of floating gives the volume a sense of weightlessness that fluctuates between enclosure and canopy. The roof structure is supported by eight slender cruciform columns that allow the roof to as effortlessly floating above the volume while freeing up the interior to allow for an open plan.  With the low roof projecting out over the exterior and the openness of the pavilion, there is a blurred spatial demarcation where ht interior becomes and exterior and exterior becomes interior.

The pavilion is designed as a proportional composition where the interior of the pavilion is juxtaposed to two reflecting pools. The smaller reflecting pool is located directly behind the interior space which allows for light to filter through the interior volume as well illuminate the marble and travertine pavers.  The larger, shallow reflecting pool compliments the volume as it stretches across the rest of the plinth.  Its elegance and sleek lines establish a place of solitude and reflection.

In addition to the design, the materials are what give the Barcelona Pavilion its true architectural essence as well as the ethereal and experiential qualities that the pavilion embodies.  The pavilion meshes the man-made and the natural employing four types of marble, steel, chrome, and glass.  The marble originates from the Swiss Alps and the Mediterranean.  Mies’ implementation of the marble is created through a process of splitting, called broaching, that creates a symmetrical patternization that’s found in the marble.  However, the most used material is the Italian travertine that wraps the plinth and the exterior walls adjacent to the reflecting pool.  When exposed to the sun, the travertine becomes illuminated almost as a secondary light source that dissolves the natural stone and washes the light over the space.  The travertine’s inherent luminous qualities as well as Mies’ seamless employment of the material over the plinth adds to the dissolution of spatial demarcation transforming the pavilion into one continuous volume rather than two separate entities. In 1930, the original Barcelona Pavilion was dismantled after the International Exposition was over; however; in 1983 a group of Catalan architects began working on rebuilding the pavilion from photographs and what little salvaged drawings that remained.  Today it is open daily and can be seen in the same location as in 1929.

The interior of the pavilion consists of offset wall places that work with the low roof plane to encourage movement, as well as activate Mies’ architectural promenade where framed views would induce movement through the narrow passage that would open into a larger volume. This cyclical process of moving throughout the pavilion sets in motion a process of discovery and rediscovery during ones experience; always offering up new perspectives and details that were previously unseen.

The roof structure is supported by eight slender cruciform columns that allow the roof to as effortlessly floating above the volume while freeing up the interior to allow for an open plan.  With the low roof projecting out over the exterior and the openness of the pavilion, there is a blurred spatial demarcation where ht interior becomes and exterior and exterior becomes interior.

The smaller reflecting pool is located directly behind the interior space which allows for light to filter through the interior volume as well illuminate the marble and travertine pavers.  The larger, shallow reflecting pool compliments the volume as it stretches across the rest of the plinth.  Its elegance and sleek lines establish a place of solitude and reflection.

With peaks and valleys echoing the nearby Alps, the vast canopy of the Munich Olympic Stadium has been a local landmark since the opening of the 1972 Olympics for which it was designed. Intended to present a new face for post-war Germany, the stadium—strikingly Modernist in character—was meant to stand in harmony with its surroundings. Despite these modest intentions, however, controversy surrounded the project from its outset, which centered on skyrocketing costs, the erosion of local heritage, and the grim specter of the country’s own recent past.With peaks and valleys echoing the nearby Alps, the vast canopy of the Munich Olympic Stadium has been a local landmark since the opening of the 1972 Olympics for which it was designed.

Despite these modest intentions, however, controversy surrounded the project from its outset, which centered on skyrocketing costs, the erosion of local heritage, and the grim specter of the country’s own recent past.The decision to hold the 1972 Summer Olympic Games in Munich held considerable political significance for the republic of West Germany. The international spectacle of the Games was one of the nation’s best chances to build a new image for itself.. The fact that the 1936 Olympics at Berlin had been a showcase for the Nazi regime gave the organizers of the Munich games even greater impetus to demonstrate that Germany had consigned that particular era to the past. As a result, and in contrast to the monumental facilities at Berlin, the Olympic site at Munich was to be more modest and subdued.[1]The decision to hold the 1972 Summer Olympic Games in Munich held considerable political significance for the republic of West Germany.

The fact that the 1936 Olympics at Berlin had been a showcase for the Nazi regime gave the organizers of the Munich games even greater impetus to demonstrate that Germany had consigned that particular era to the past. As a result, and in contrast to the monumental facilities at Berlin, the Olympic site at Munich was to be more modest and subdued.[1]It was this spirit which characterized the scheme by Behnisch and Partners (B+P), the Stuttgart firm which prevailed in the contest to design the facilities for the Olympics. Seeking to avoid the inherent monumentality of individual structures, their proposal was to gather the various venues and accessory functions close enough together to be united by a common structural element. The concept for the stadium itself was derived from the ‘earth stadiums’ commonly built in Eastern Europe since the end of the First World War: taking advantage of the existing topography, space for the field and seating for 90,000 spectators would be carved out of the ground instead of built above it. It was as much a symbolic choice as a practical one, as a stadium set into the earth would not present visitors with an imposing edifice, but blend more subtly into the ideal Bavarian landscape being created on the rest of the site.[2]It was this spirit which characterized the scheme by Behnisch and Partners (B+P), the Stuttgart firm which prevailed in the contest to design the facilities for the Olympics.

Otto had spent a decade studying the enclosure of space under suspended roofs, gaining particular attention for his contribution to the German pavilion at Expo ‘67 in Montréal. Working together with B+P, Otto helped to devise a scheme for tensile roofs of steel cable and acrylic panels, stretching over the Olympic site like a massive, segmented tent. The translucent canopy was designed to shelter the athletes and spectators without obscuring lines of sight or casting uneven shadows that would impede upon televised footage of the Games.[3]While the sunken arenas were developed by B+P, the firm turned to designer Frei Otto for the element which would tie the entire complex together.

The translucent canopy was designed to shelter the athletes and spectators without obscuring lines of sight or casting uneven shadows that would impede upon televised footage of the Games.[3]Even though B+P’s concept had been awarded first place, it was not without staunch resistance. Multiple organizations in and around Munich stood opposed to the encroachment of Modernist architecture, spurring debate which proceeded throughout the 1960s. With these conservative influences at play, B+P had felt it unlikely that their submission stood much chance to win the competition. However, both the Mayor of Munich and the jury chair, Egon Eiermann, stood by the proposal, shielding it from early elimination. Even after the competition ended, however, opponents of the design took each opportunity possible to stymie progress. Tensions came to a head in 1967 when B+P threatened to sue the Olympia Baugesellschaft which, acting on a report by two local professors that deemed the tensile roof system unfeasible, had asked the third-place contestants to devise an alternate canopy scheme. Even after this snarl was settled out of court, the communal planning bureaucracy launched its own campaign against the stadium by delaying each successive permit as long as it could.[4]Even though B+P’s concept had been awarded first place, it was not without staunch resistance.

The enormous structure ultimately covered almost 75,000 square meters (807,293 square feet), making it the most ambitious construction project West Germany had ever seen. It was an impressive technical feat, but one which left Frei Otto disenchanted and even bitter. As a strict functionalist, Otto was never pleased with the symbolic nature of the project. The use of Plexiglass for the canopy went beyond the normal light membranes Otto worked with, a factor which grated against his vision of a temporary structure and caused the budget for the project to rise dramatically.[5]Local resistance may have delayed completion of the stadium, but it did not stop it. 436 kilometers (271 miles) of steel cables were strung between fifty-eight cast steel pylons, supporting a sinuous canopy composed of eight thousand Plexiglass panels.

With its clear axes and bold Neoclassical buildings, Werner March’s design for the 1936 Berlin Olympics was an architectural boast, proclaiming the power of the Third Reich through its visual domination of its surroundings. In contrast, Munich’s stadium stood equal with—even subordinate to—an environment of hills, streams, and small lakes. Colors such as red, gold, and purple were also deemed suggestive of dictatorship and therefore eschewed in favor of the natural blues and greens of the Bavarian countryside – ironically paying respect to the local heritage the design was accused of disregarding altogether.[6]While Otto’s vision of a light, cost-efficient structure did not come to pass, site planning succeeded in achieving Behnisch’s goal to distance the new Olympic Park from its fascist predecessor.

The ensuing rescue attempt ended disastrously, casting a pall over the remainder of the event and setting new security standards for subsequent Olympic Games.[7] Despite these unfortunate events, the work of B+P and Frei Otto has become a celebrated landmark in a city which once reviled it. The stadium still stands, its innovative canopy slated to undergo a renovation costing over 100million EUR (approximately 118million USD), having survived public outcry and its own designer’s frustrated intentions to become a lasting monument for the people of modern Germany.[8]Tragedy ultimately overshadowed architectural splendor and West German democracy when Palestinian terrorists took nine members of the Israeli team hostage.

Text description provided by the architects. Lehrer Architects were challenged to create an efficient, yet pleasant, space for those employed in the Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk Elections Operations Center. More-efficient storage space was also needed to house more than 1,200 pallets containing voting material and 5,000 new ballot reading and voter accessibility devices. Space was also allocated for the tax, birth, marriage, property, and death records for the County of Los Angeles, which are all stored here.

Beyond the warehouse workspace, 18,000 square feet were provided for administrative offices. Several cubicles for those on the main floor of the warehouse, a break room/kitchen, and restrooms were also designed.  Constructing a safe, streamlined, welcoming, and flexible space for all employees—40 year-round, up to 600 during voting season—was key to the design plans.

Lehrer Architects tackled this design project by first reducing the projected expenses by 25 percent by taking the Development Commission’s original, awkward, over-budget plan and redesigning it to create an efficient, streamlined work place.  The architects considered function, color, size, placement, and basic proportions in configuring a space that effected a positive change in how employees work.

Here in the warehouse was an opportunity to implement bright, bold colors—clearly contrasting the administrative area—and it proved to be a thrifty way of making large-scale change in the space.  Bright reds, oranges, and greens energize the entire area, including the 12-foot-high divider walls placed in different areas of the warehouse.  A bright-red wall leads into the space beyond the entrance and offices that front the building.

A critical architectural move was the use of mega-banner technology to give scale and intimacy to the huge warehouse.  The architect envisioned large-scale banners that could display symbols or imagery.  In a matter of creative funding, the clients worked with the Los Angeles County Arts Commission and the One Percent for Art Program to commission a local artist, UCLA Professor, Rebeca Mendez.  The artist created a hanging banner measuring 15 feet wide and 132 feet long.  Titled Tree by Tree, from Sea to Mountains, 2008, the panoramic sequence of photographs runs from the Pacific Ocean to the San Gabriel Mountains, showing trees, water, and sky, and turns the cavernous space into a more intimate-feeling spot.  Another set of  9 nature-themed vertical banners were placed at the ends of the 30 foot height, 200 foot long stacks, creating a 35,000 square foot  “room” in which most warehouse workers spend their day.

To make the towering pallet racks easy to use, the architect organized them in a serial fashion, placing them far enough apart to accommodate rolling staircase-type ladders used to reach documents on high shelves.  A series of uniformly spaced wide orange stripes painted on the floor lead and direct workers to the stacks and connect to the individual banners hanging from the ends of the stacks, creating a symbiotic relationship between the two.  The light orange background and similar nature-themed imagery of these banners act as a unifying factor for the entire warehouse space.  The stripes, used in several places throughout the warehouse, including the restrooms, suggest a subtle flag motif. When it comes time for workers to take a lunch break, they visit the employee café.  It is the only completely enclosed and air-conditioned space on the warehouse floor.  A simple plastic gymnasium curtain was used to enclose the bright green and gray café, keeping it temperate, comfortable and light-filled.  That less costly curtain—which also uses stripes, but in a horizontal application—cut out the need for a dark ceiling, making the area much more open and inviting to employees.

Text description provided by the architects. Built for the 1964 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, the Yoyogi National Gymnasium has become an architectural icon for its distinctive design. Designed by one of Japan’s most famous modernist architects, Kenzo Tange, the gymnasium is a hybridization of western modernist aesthetics and traditional Japanese architecture.

Tange’s innovative structural design creates dramatic sweeping curves that appear to effortlessly drape from two large, central supporting cables. It’s dynamically suspended roof and rough materials form one of the most iconic building profiles in the world.

Sitting within one of the largest parks in the metropolitan region of Tokyo, Tange uses the context as a way in which to integrate his building into the landscape. The subtle curves of the structural cables, the sweeping roof plane, and the curving concrete base seem to emerge from the site appearing as one integrated entity.

The smaller pavilion which holds approximately 5,300 people is used for various small Olympic events, whereas the national gymnasium was designed to be occupied by 10,500 people primarily for the Olympic swimming and diving competitions.  However, it was able to be transformed into a space to accommodate for larger events such as basketball and ice hockey.

Influenced by Le Corbusier’s Philip’s Pavilion and Eero Saarinen’s hockey stadium at Yale University, Tange became intrigued with structure and its tensile and geometric potential. Similar to Saarinen’s design for Yale’s hockey stadium, Tange employs a central structural spine from where the structure and roof originates. Two large steel cables are supported between two structural towers in addition to being anchored into concrete supports on the ground. The suspended cables form a tensile tent-like roofing structure; a series of pre-stressed cables are suspended off of the two main cables that drape toward the concrete structure that creates the base of the gymnasium as well as providing the necessary structure for the seating within the stadium.

The result is a symmetrical suspension structure that elegantly draping from the central structural spine.  It‘s flowing surfaces make the minimal surface structure appear as a fabric suspended by two simple supports that’s being pulled into tension by the landscape.

Today, it is one of Tokyo’s most sought after tourist destinations, while continuing to be an international venue for sports and fashion."We Japanese architects, in our endeavours to resolve the problems facing modern Japan, have devoted a great deal of attention to the Japanese tradition, and have, in the end, arrived at the point which I have sought to elucidate for you. If, however, there can be detected a trace of tradition in my works or in those of my generation, then our creative powers have not been at their best, then we are still in the throes of evolving our creativity.

By the year 2030, 25% of the land area of Mumbai will be covered by parked cars. — Mumbai Traffic Police By the year 2030, 25% of the land area of Mumbai will be covered by parked cars. — Mumbai Traffic PoliceProject Description This project addresses Mumbai’s increasing congestion and pollution. The TATA Corporation is the largest automaker in India and manufacturer of the Nano, the world’s cheapest car ($2500 US). The tower is seen as a development for TATA offices and employee residences, all of which drive alternative energy Nano cars. TATA Tower aims to be part of a much larger solution to the city’s crumbling infrastructure. Energy demands of the building and vehicles are met by photovoltaic louvers, building-integrated wind turbines, tri-generation, and an algae farm which produces biodiesel. Vertical parking allows for maximum parking density, gathering parked cars to act as a parking resource for neighboring linked towers. This also frees up space for a more pedestrian oriented ground plane, allowing for parks, recreation and increased public transportation.Project Description This project addresses Mumbai’s increasing congestion and pollution.

A constant background sound-scape and an expanding RGB light communicate through the wall, transforming the structure into a living organism in which the visitor is completely involved.The interactive mechanisms are engaged by touching or shaking stem light fittings installed in the floor. A camera records the movement of these fittings and transmits it to a computer. The computer transforms the visual signal into frequencies and finally translates them into a visual and audio installation. Each of the stem light fittings triggers a distinctive interplay of sounds recorded from the pavilion construction phase and affect the color changing lighting performance. This generates layering of interweaving media reactions that engulfs the visitor from multiple directions and let him/her become the performer and the observer at the same time.

Text description provided by the architects. Located in Kansas City, Kansas, this environmentally conscious, modern home performs completely off the grid in an area desperately in need of revitalization. Being the first LEED Platinum home in the Kansas City Metropolitan area, the building serves as an example of sustainable practice and living for buyers who desire life in the city close to the urban core. This house is a combination of passive strategies and active systems which visually call out the environmental standards to which the design aspires.

The Sustainable Residence is designed by Studio 804, a not‐for profit design/build program that serves as the final design studio for graduate students at the University of Kansas School of Architecture and Urban Planning.  The student led process creates prefabricated architecture while thoughtfully responding to global problems of density and sustainability using smaller scale, local solutions.Follow the break for more photographs and drawings of this residence.

SiteA site with a broad south exposure was chosen to support the passive solar effort.   Additionally, operable windows provided along the lower southern strip of glazing and rooftop skylights allow for stack ventilation throughout the interior.  The entire site was planted with a drought-resistant fescue sod that is highly recommended in Kansas as a replacement for conventional turf.  All hardscape surfaces surrounding the exterior of the house are porous materials such as pervious concrete, which permits the rainwater to seep into the water table.

Sunflower Army Ammunition PlantThe Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant, located between Lawrence and Kansas City, was established in 1941 as one of the world’s largest powder and propellant plants, later playing a historic role providing ammunition during World War II and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts. The ammunition plant, now an excess federal property, is being rehabilitated for public use through Sunflower Redevelopment. Of the original five thousand retired ammunition buildings, over one thousand are designated free of contaminants.The rights were secured to harvest the 70-year-old Douglas Fir from Sunflower.  The reclaimed boards were used for interior walls and structural support.

Sustainable DesignThe residence's ability to be off the grid eliminates the homeowner’s consistent dependency on natural resources such as coal and gas, decreasing the building’s overall impact on the environment.   The house’s total energy needs are reduced by the use of renewable energy sources, including a wind turbine and photovoltaic solar panels, as a means of power.  The use of low-flow valve fixtures, along with a rainwater reclamation system, allows the residence to rely less on public water resources. The combination of a radiant floor system and concrete thermal mass minimizes the daily temperature fluctuation. Also, the design’s use of a geothermal heat pump, Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV), and highly efficient HVAC improves the effectiveness of all the sustainable systems.ConstructionWood was the natural choice for building due to its economy, ease of assembly, and speed of erection.   FSC-certified wood was used in the framing and sheathing of all walls, roof, and floor in order to ensure the product was properly harvested.  Each framing member was precisely measured and cut to achieve a waste factor of only 4.37%.  If short anywhere within the calculations, reclaimed lumber from Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant was to be used in its place.

Environmentally Preferred MaterialsRegionally manufactured, reclaimed, and recycled content materials were used throughout the design.  FSC lumber and the reclaimed lumber from Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant were used to frame the walls.  Also, the Galvalume metal roofing panels are recyclable and contain a minimum of 25% recycled content.  The Xcell blown cellulose insulation was manufactured locally from recycled paper fiber.   The concrete mix included 30% fly ash, a byproduct of the coal industry.

Interior ApplicationsThe majority of the wood used throughout the interior framing is recycled from the deconstruction of the former Sunflower ammunition facility and framed on two-foot centers to reduce material usage.  FSC-certified Jatoba hardwood flooring is featured in the upstairs loft and bedroom spaces and continues to wrap the kitchen ceiling to achieve a visual link between spaces. All countertops and bathroom surrounds are manufactured from a recycled paper composite material that is highly durable, low maintenance, and stain resistant.

Exterior ApplicationsThe vertical application of the FSC-certified tropical Cumaru wood rainscreen wraps the entire exterior of the residence.   Precisely detailed, twenty-four photovoltaic panels are located on the southern roof  plane flush with the Cumaru rainscreen.  Rainwater is collected in the remaining 50% of the roof along the north side and stored in an underground cistern.  The rainscreen uses the wood barrier to compartmentalize the air cavity, thereby allowing rapid air pressure equalization and minimal moisture intrusion.

Additionally, operable windows provided along the lower southern strip of glazing and rooftop skylights allow for stack ventilation throughout the interior.  The entire site was planted with a drought-resistant fescue sod that is highly recommended in Kansas as a replacement for conventional turf.  All hardscape surfaces surrounding the exterior of the house are porous materials such as pervious concrete, which permits the rainwater to seep into the water table.A site with a broad south exposure was chosen to support the passive solar effort.

The ammunition plant, now an excess federal property, is being rehabilitated for public use through Sunflower Redevelopment. Of the original five thousand retired ammunition buildings, over one thousand are designated free of contaminants.The Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant, located between Lawrence and Kansas City, was established in 1941 as one of the world’s largest powder and propellant plants, later playing a historic role providing ammunition during World War II and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts.

The reclaimed boards were used for interior walls and structural support.Sustainable DesignSustainable DesignThe residence's ability to be off the grid eliminates the homeowner’s consistent dependency on natural resources such as coal and gas, decreasing the building’s overall impact on the environment.   The house’s total energy needs are reduced by the use of renewable energy sources, including a wind turbine and photovoltaic solar panels, as a means of power.  The use of low-flow valve fixtures, along with a rainwater reclamation system, allows the residence to rely less on public water resources. The combination of a radiant floor system and concrete thermal mass minimizes the daily temperature fluctuation. Also, the design’s use of a geothermal heat pump, Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV), and highly efficient HVAC improves the effectiveness of all the sustainable systems.The residence's ability to be off the grid eliminates the homeowner’s consistent dependency on natural resources such as coal and gas, decreasing the building’s overall impact on the environment.

FSC-certified wood was used in the framing and sheathing of all walls, roof, and floor in order to ensure the product was properly harvested.  Each framing member was precisely measured and cut to achieve a waste factor of only 4.37%.  If short anywhere within the calculations, reclaimed lumber from Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant was to be used in its place.Wood was the natural choice for building due to its economy, ease of assembly, and speed of erection.

Text description provided by the architects. The Prescott Passivhaus is a single-family, low-energy residence located in Kansas City, Kansas. This unique house is designed for the affordable-housing market as a spec house that will sell to qualified buyers, those with an annual income of no more than eighty percent of the target Area Median Income (AMI).

Designed to exceed both Passivhaus and LEED Platinum standards, the residence uses minimal energy through affordable passive means. The home is located in the Prescott neighborhood which, despite being just minutes from downtown Kansas City, remains a neighborhood in transition not unlike the rest of the derelict urban core that typifies the city.This intriguing wood clad Passivhaus acts as a prototype for the region. It aims at being the first certified Passivhaus in the state of Kansas, and is one of only a handful in the country. To obtain its goal of a ninety percent reduction in heating and cooling energy demand, the house uses low-cost passive strategies such as louvers, thermal mass, high performance windows, super insulation, southern orientation, and an airtight building envelope. An energy recovery ventilator works in conjunction with these strategies to temper fresh intake air with energy from the exhaust air, providing constant fresh air year round.

Under the guidance of the LEED Platinum criteria, measures were taken to ensure the sustainability of the Prescott Passive House in ways beyond merely energy efficiency. Site location and treatment, material content, construction waste management, and water efficiency were all carefully examined.

This 1,700 square foot, three bedroom, two bath residence bestows many amenities within a small ecological footprint. Despite its modest size, the open floor plan creates a surprisingly spacious interior. A double height living room connects the main floor with the upper level, where the master bedroom is located. The stacked master bathroom and main floor bathroom are flooded with natural light through an internal two-story frosted glass wall across from the expansive southern glazing. Overlooking the living room and southern array of windows is the flexible loft space. On the main level, the living room is connected to the kitchen and dining spaces with an exposed concrete thermal mass floor. These living areas are located just off of the 400 sf deck, which lends uninhibited views of the Prescott neighborhood and the Kansas City skyline while doubly functioning as the carport roof. At the west end of the main level are two additional bedrooms with views to the surrounding double width lot. Remote controlled operable skylights create the only break in the northern envelope of the house, and operable glazing stretches the entire length of the southern side to encourage natural ventilation. This impressive façade is protected by louvers optimally angled to allow winter heat gain yet block sunlight from penetrating the house in the summer. Downstairs, a full walkout basement provides ample storage as well as a finished flex room located directly off of the carport.

A sixteen inch thick insulated wall assembly and a twenty-two inch thick insulated roof assembly provide the basis for a home that seeks a ninety percent reduction in heating and cooling energy. This airtight assembly nearly eliminates all heat transfer through the building envelope, keeping all heat gained from the high performance glazing within the house. The energy recovery ventilator and thermal masses seek to further maintain a constant interior temperature, reducing most needs for additional tempering support. Outside, clotheslines discourage the use of an electric clothes dryer, one of the least efficient of the house’s appliances, all of which have received the Energy Star rating.

Due to Passivhaus strategies, engineered wood was the only choice for framing. The entire house was framed in engineered lumber. The width of the TJI joists allowed for the wall (12”) and roof (16”) depths needed to house the thick cellulose insulation required for Passivhaus. In addition, the creation of a primary structural system to carry the ridge load through columns to the foundation was accomplished with Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL). This enabled the space to remain open, so all rooms could be filled with natural light, a principle tenet of our energy-saving concept. We could not have achieved our design goals without the use of engineered lumber.

In the spirit of the age-old Japanese shou-sugi-ban tradition, the exterior of the Prescott Passivhaus is clad in a charred Douglas fir rain screen. This low-maintenance assembly yields a UV-protected dark black finish to the house. Recycled paper windowsills and countertops, bamboo flooring, and a concrete, thermal mass-providing floor complement the clean white interior walls and ceiling.Being the first new construction in its Kansas City, Kansas neighborhood in many decades, the Prescott Passive House breathes new life into an established neighborhood. With its sustainable energy conservation strategies, the home has further served as an educational tool to the community throughout the construction process.

Text description provided by the architects. Located on Minnesota’s western prairie, the University of Minnesota, Morris, is a national leader in campus sustainability—through sustainable development and the addition of its own wind power generator and biomass energy plant. This renovation of a two-story, 18,700 square-foot 1915 historic building serves two purposes: to act as a gateway for all visitors (including prospective students, parents, and alumni) and be a centerpiece for the campus’ commitment to sustainable design.

Started as a boarding school for Native American youth, the school eventually transitioned into the West Central School of Agriculture with courses in agriculture, industry, and home economics. Now the University of Minnesota, Morris, the school is a liberal arts college that still includes courses related to its educational roots along with new curriculum focusing on a renewable, sustainable education. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Welcome Center was built in 1915 when it was known as the Engineering building. It now houses the offices of Admissions, Sustainability, External Relations, Community Engagement, and the Center for Small Towns.

For the first time in its history, there is a clear entry to the Morris campus. At the edge of the historic center of campus, the Welcome Center is easily accessible, prominent, and located adjacent to parking. Because of the wide range of visitors to campus the building needed to impress 18 to 80-year-olds. Visitors are welcomed by a carefully restored exterior with classic proportions, a clear entry, and signage denoting the Historic District and a new historic walking tour.

While the exterior transformation is more subtle (following the Secretary of the Interior’s historic guidelines), the formerly dark, dingy interior has been dramatically recast – with bright daylit open spaces, warm colors reminiscent of the surrounding prairie, and modern furnishings. Updated space layouts provide open sightlines and clear pathways, focal reception points, and educational media with real-time updates on campus events, news, and sustainability information.

Anticipating LEED Gold certification, the building incorporates the first application of chilled beams in the state and is the first building listed on the National Register of Historic Places to use chilled beam technology throughout the entire building. 3,000 square feet of mechanical space is eliminated, freeing space for open circulation, additional program area, and daylighting. This creative approach to sustainable design keeps the integrity of the historic building intact and reduces energy consumption.

The Olympic Ski Jump in Garmisch-Partenkirchen is one of the most renowned facilities of its kind, having hosted the New Year ski jumping competition as part of the international Four Hills Tournament for 55 years. Now, after the advance premiere in January 2008, the new Olympic ski-jumping sports facility, designed by the young Munich ofce of Prof. Klaus Loenhart and Christoph Mayr, terrain: loenhart&mayr architects and landscape architects, will be ofcially opened in December of this year.Due to a required upgrade of the jump to the advanced technical standards of the International Skiing Federation (FIS), the construction of an entirely new ski jump was inevitable. Among projects by Zaha Hadid Architects, Behnisch Architects and others, an international architectural competition in autumn 2006 led to the decision to erect a cantilevering structure as the new landmark of ski sports in the valley of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. In the course of designing the ski jump, the terrain:loenhart&mayr ofce drew inspiration from the local topography of mount Gudiberg. The connecting lines of the new ski-jumping facility are an interpretation of the gentle curved lines of the outposts of the chain of mountains. Through its integrative and linear aesthetics of undulating lines, the new design of the jump ties in separate functional entities, including delivery and access points, to form a dynamic landscape-building unit. As much the goal was to develop a topographically rooted architecture for the new Olympic skijumping hill, it is meant to work in a dialectical mode: Topographic integration links up with sculptural expressiveness, giving the new jump in Garmisch-Partenkirchen its unique characteristic appearance. At the same time, its architectural impression and formal dynamics also invites associations with the risk and acceleration of the ski-jumping sport.

The quest to overcome gravitation, inherently linked with ski jumping, is architecturally expressed by the cantilevering inrun of the ski jump. In the more than 100-metre-long inrun structure, athletes, coaches, press representatives, and visitors can walk up the 332 steps of the "Jacob's ladder" to arrive at the three competition decks.Alternatively, and less strenuously, the decks can also be accessed with the newly developed diagonal elevator. Athletes have nicknamed the new facility the "Olympic Cantilever". The design of the inrun track is also a novelty. The jump is virtually independent of the weather in winter due to its minimal snow volume requirement and energy demand. Thanks to the additional thermoplastic track, the jump can be used in summer without having to be converted.The entire inrun structure is covered with translucent polycarbonate elements whose appearance changes with the daylight and respective lighting. During the day, the new jump forms a harmonious unity with the surrounding snowcovered landscape. Light and shadow on the white panels establish a suggestive relationship with the surrounding winter landscape. After sunset, the artifcial light illuminates the architectural body from inside, turning the cantilevering building into an illuminated sculpture that is visible even at great distance in the valley of Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

Text description provided by the architects. In 2009 West 8’s winning design for Lincoln Park was unanimously chosen by the Miami Beach Commission. The park is part of the New World Symphony Campus of architect Frank Gehry, which includes a concert hall and a conservatory.  The Lincoln Park site is a small – slightly larger than 1 hectare in size – urban site located at Washington Avenue and 17th Street in South Florida that strives to establish a new precedent for parks in the City of Miami Beach.

While an urban park this size might often receive a design that has more hard surface than soft, Lincoln Park’s site-specific conditions, context and program elicited a unique response in a green park, not a plaza, that feels intimate, shady, and soft; a park that will support the world-class attraction of the New World Symphony Building. Lincoln Park reflects the spirit and vitality of Miami Beach and will support a multitude of day and night uses, either under the shade of the trees or a starlit sky.

Lincoln Park will also have the wonder of some totally unique features that are one of a kind.  First, several pergolas embrace the park edges; their shape inspired by the puffy cumulous clouds inherent in South Florida’s tropical climate. The hand-fabricated painted aluminium structures not only provide shade but will support the spectacular blooms of bougainvillea vines; highlighting a threshold of colour at the parks points of entry. High quality artwork is equally important here, and the projection wall of the adjacent Symphony Hall building is an ideal 'canvas' for video projection artists - an emerging and exciting discipline within the art world. West 8 has designed a projection tower and 'Ballet Bar' to house the extensive multimedia equipment provided within the park.

The awkwardly shaped large site at West Side Highway and 57th Street is about to get a whole lot more attention. Bjarke Ingels and BIG will finally make their architectural debut in North America, with an unusual apartment building design in none other than New York City. The asymmetrical peak almost pyramid in shape is the result of blending the mismatched forms of a typical Manhattan tower podium and a low-rise apartment block European in style.The awkwardly shaped large site at West Side Highway and 57th Street is about to get a whole lot more attention.

The asymmetrical peak almost pyramid in shape is the result of blending the mismatched forms of a typical Manhattan tower podium and a low-rise apartment block European in style.BIG’s reinvention of the ‘New York apartment building’ somehow is able to check all of the boxes, providing a connection to the waterfront and the Hudson River Park, acknowledging the surrounding context both in relationship to building size and neighbors’ views, and alleviating traffic noise. The leafy green courtyards that pop up within this new residential typology help to balance a steeply sloped facade, 450-feet at its peak. Designed for client Durst Fetner Residential, the building offers both a cultural and commercial program and will accommodate 600 residential units varying in size.BIG’s reinvention of the ‘New York apartment building’ somehow is able to check all of the boxes, providing a connection to the waterfront and the Hudson River Park, acknowledging the surrounding context both in relationship to building size and neighbors’ views, and alleviating traffic noise.

With an efficient layout and a sense of intimacy, the perimeter block meets demands for density and security. In this project, we have married it to the traditional Manhattan high-rise, creating a unique shape which combines the advantages of both: the compactness of a courtyard  with the airiness and the amazing views of a skyscraper. The form of the building shifts depending on the viewer’s vantage point. From the West Side Highway, it appears to be a pyramid; from West 58th, a dramatic glass spire.

While the courtyard is a private space for residents, it can still be seen from the outside, creating a visual connection to the greenery of the Hudson River Park. The slope of the building allows for a transition in scale between the low-rise structures to the south and the high-rise residential towers to the north and west of the site.

Text description provided by the architects. The building has a tangential position with respect to the city and is part of the first urban development on the far side of the A2 dual carriage way. Originally, the NII, the road connecting Madrid and Barcelona, passed through Guadalajara's urban area. As the population increased, the daily and continued use of this road began to cause serious trouble, forcing to build a bypass road in the year 1959. Over time, the road became a dual carriageway, establishing the limit of the urban development for over thirty years. At present, this border has been exceeded again by new tertiary and commercial developments that, after jumping over this main interurban road, have started to conquer the outer edge of the dual carriageway along the southeast perimeter.

At the same time, the City Council approved a bylaw to develop the buildable area allocated to these plots in volumes of up to fifteen stories above ground level, representing a firm commitment of the municipal Corporation for these sectors. From then on, these edge grounds get an extraordinary hegemonic importance as new developments' axis and begin to influence in order to attract companies, trading firms and financial institutions wishing to operate in the Corredor. This circumstance causes a displacement to the south of Guadalajara's traditional city centre and generates a unique and unprecedented façade on one of the most important roads in the country.

The job is born of the free will of CajaGuadalajara. This institution, which is aware of the need to renovate its somewhat outdated and obsolete head office for it to be renewed by other installations in line with the services and facilities required by the current financial environment, decides to move to a better area with greater social meaning and build there a more contemporary and representative office. For that purpose, CajaGuadalajara choose a plot of one of the edge sectors located at the other side of the A2 dual carriageway.

Trying to achieve uniqueness, last-generation technological facilities and environmental sustainability, the building is constructed within the plot, parallel to the dual carriageway, in front of another office tower. Both towers share a unitary pedestal and the space between them is used to build a common square. This platform, facing midday, links the cultural activity of CajaGuadalajara to a varied supply of shops and accessorial services located on the same height and with access from this area.

The aesthetic image of the building is interpreted as a millefeuille tower composed by a grid of horizontal glass panes, and is protected and characterized by a random sequence of horizontal sun breakers. Consequence and result of the fleetingness of a glance from the dual carriageway, it is intended that the building appears as a sculptural building block without scale which is only defined by the shadows produced by the aluminium sheets and where references to both floorslabs and to structural elements disappear.

Text description provided by the architects. Commission: The assignment was to relocate the new head offices of a film and TV production company (recording, editing, dubbing and audiovisual production). The program of functions can be classified in four parts: management and administrative area (offices and meeting rooms), technical rooms (audio, image, set and backstage), common public area (multifunctional space, toilets and cafeteria) and installation area (machine and storage rooms).

Concept: The concept of the project is to create a work space that thanks to its transparency can show the visitor the production process. The most important work rooms, where the “product” of the company is being made, should be visible to the visitor and client. As a result a transparent volume is created to locate the main work rooms in the center of the space. A showcase volume, open, transparent and visible to everyone. This central piece articulates and separates functions within the office, acting as an organizing piece.

Construction: The central volume is formed by a sequence of wooden frames, formed by a laminated pine structure 80mmx120mm thick. The enclosure is solved with methacrylate and plywood pine panels depending on the needs of the interior work rooms. The wooden structure on the outside is used to create “vitrine” shelves where the videotapes, created by the firm, are stored; following the concept of the central volume as a showcase structure.

The interior partition walls of the nave have wooden wool panels as paneling material, 60cmx60cm in dimension, fixed to a wooden strip grid. This material helps the technical rooms acoustically and allow the electrical installations  to be accessible.

Due to the low height of the space and the complexity of the preexisting and new installations (air-conditioning, electricity, plumbing and IT) the decision is taken to leave them in sight. To solve the ceiling aesthetically and acoustically a continuous layer is projected. The covering is applied in black due to the strict luminic needs of the technical rooms. The central nave, where the most complex rooms qua installations are located, is fed by accessible metal trays which help the maintenance of the complicated electrical needs.

Text description provided by the architects. The New York based practice, Pompei A.D., was hired to design the firsts Tanishq stores in the U.S. and sent us some pictures of the one located in Garden State Plaza Mall in Paramus, N.J.More pictures and some drawings after the break. The concept for the Tanishq store developed out of a study of the relationship between the customer and the jewelry, along with the role that nature plays in binding them together. Jewelry is created by taking elements from nature and refining them. Human beings are similar in that we are products of nature but have spent our lives refining ourselves. The design of the store brings these two together in a "garden", an oasis where the customer is free to relax while her senses are enlivened by the depth of the experience.

Customers are initially drawn to the store by the sculptural storefront. From a distance views into the store are diffused by a delicate laser cut screen. An organic non orthogonal layout inside the store encourages customers to meander through the space. With multiple pathways, the customer creates her own unique experience as she walks around sculptural elements with jewelry displayed. Plants cascade over the tops of white concrete and terra-cotta colored plaster walls with a wall of plants cutting the space into two distinct areas.

By rethinking the entire jewelry buying experience, the store design creates opportunities for better interaction between the employees and customers. As customers walk along the wall mounted jewelry display niches, the store employees are able to stand next to them and talk to them about the jewelry. Additionally, there are tables and a lounge spread around the store encouraging customers to sit and relax while shopping.

Text description provided by the architects. One of the most immediate impact of the real estate boom experienced in Spain between the years 2000 and 2007 was the expansion abroad of some major companies which, driven by various factors (such as credited specialization, exhaustion of domestic demand, increase in cost of land acquired within the country and experience in the construction and sale of such assets, among others), and having a good knowledge that certain places are in need of dwellings –in particular the countries of Eastern Europe–, the early years of the century witnessed an outstanding landing of the Spanish real estate business abroad.

Later on, because of the global crisis and the collapse of the real estate bubble, many of these colonizing adventures –in numerous cases, purely speculative operations– were abruptly vanished. However, there were other professionally designed developments rooted in the different nationwide realities which came off strongly, to the point that they became innovative references both for their positive result in the domestic market and for collaborating in the housing policy parallel undertook by local governments. It is the case of this development which the Spanish company Hercesa is erecting in phases in a dense popular area of Bucharest.

It is the case of this development which the Spanish company Hercesa is erecting in phases in a dense popular area of Bucharest.Later on, because of the global crisis and the collapse of the real estate bubble, many of these colonizing adventures –in numerous cases, purely speculative operations– were abruptly vanished.

Text description provided by the architects. The High Museum of Art is a major public building and art repository that responds to the typological and contextual aspects of the museum's program. The city of Atlanta's progressive building tradition, as well as its role as a developing cultural center, had a strong influence on the design.

The corner site, at the junction of Peachtree and Sixteenth streets about two miles from downtown Atlanta, places the museum at an important location for Atlanta's development and within a pedestrian-oriented neighborhood with good public transportation access.

The parti consists of four quadrants with one carved out, to distinguish it from the other three; the missing quadrant becomes a monumental atrium, the lobby and the ceremonial center of the museum.

The extended ramp is a symbolic gesture reaching out to the street and city, and a foil to the interior ramp that is the building's chief formal and circulatory element. At the end of the ramp is the main entry and reception area, from which one passes into the four-story atrium.

The light-filled atrium space is inspired by, and a commentary on, the central space of the Guggenheim Museum.

As in the Guggenheim, the ramp system mediates between the central space and the art itself. In the Guggenheim, however, the ramp doubles as a gallery; in Atlanta, the separation of circulation and gallery space allows the central space to govern the system of movement.

This separation also allows the atrium walls to have windows, which admit natural light and offer framed views of the city.

The galleries are organized to provide multiple vistas as well as intimate and large-scale viewing to accommodate the diverse needs of the collection.Light, whether direct or filtered, is a constant preoccupation throughout; apart from its functional aspect, light is a symbol of the museum's role as a place of aesthetic illumination and enlightened cultural values. The primary intention of the architecture is to encourage the discovery of these values, and to foster a contemplative appreciation of the museum's collection through spatial experience.

Text description provided by the architects. The realized work for the Núñez family consisted of the transformation of an old apartment into a contemporary urban home. 
Save this picture!

The project resumes four punctual operations that try to set a relation between the existent organization and the new function. The first one is the inversion of the separate uses of the two floors of the house. With the addition of a bathroom and a closet in place of the former living room, the goal of placing all bedrooms on first floor is achieved.  Which, in turn, liberates the upper floor and its terrace for a functional common space for the whole family. The second intervention consists of occupation of half of the terrace with a light construction, which integrates the space with the kitchen, dining area, and living room. The rooftop of this space is used to create an extension that leads to the third operation: convertion of the water tank into an open-air swimming pool. Finally, a shadow device incorporates to the project the irregularity of the walls from neighboring buildings, trapping a great volume of air and creating an specific atmosphere for the new house.

Text description provided by the architects. For decades, the residents of Yountville, California, a rural town in Napa County, relied on a small 1920s-era community hall and a hodgepodge of spaces rented from others to host community events. The hall was in need of renovation, ill-equipped to support art classes, and lacking in outdoor recreation spaces. In addition, the town had outgrown its library. In 1998, after surveying residents’ needs, the municipality embarked on a planning process for an expanded town center at the heart of town.

The Yountville Town Center weaves new and existing buildings and outdoor rooms into a place designed to enrich community life. Located on a 2.5-acre site on Yountville’s main street, the town center consists of a new 10,000-square-foot community center, the renovated 4,800-square-foot community hall, and the addition of a sheriff’s substation to the adjacent post office. The new community center houses a branch library, multipurpose room, teen center, and meeting and program spaces. It opens onto a new town square framed by the existing community hall and the post office.

Building exteriors blend with the rural character, while inside the spaces are light and airy. The large multipurpose room, 80 feet long by 50 feet wide, is day-lit along the roof’s spine by a ridge skylight, which has splayed walls that soften the light as it enters the room. A unique combination of Douglas fir trusses and cables enables the roof’s structural support system to have a minimal presence in the room and avoids blocking daylight from above. A large, covered porch of red cedar on two sides of the town square connects the community hall and community center, providing shade in the summer. Barn doors extend the multipurpose room onto the adjacent barbecue patio.

Targeted to achieve a LEED Platinum rating from the U.S. Green Building Council and to achieve energy savings of 44% over Title 24, the design integrates a range of green features. Walkways and bike paths connect the center to surrounding neighborhoods and main street activities. Exterior sunshades, a highly insulated building envelope, and “cool” standing seam metal roofs reduce energy use.

Energy-efficient mechanical systems are integrated with ground-source heat pumps for heating and cooling. A building integrated management system takes advantage of the temperate climate by opening skylights and windows on days with mild temperatures. Operable skylights, controlled by CO2 and rain sensors, and operable windows provide natural ventilation and balanced natural illumination.

Roof-mounted photovoltaic laminates on the new and existing buildings supply energy. Water-conserving plumbing fixtures, harvested rainwater, drip irrigation, subsurface irrigation, and drought-tolerant native plants further reduce water use. The existing parking lot was regraded to slope naturally so that rainwater could be harvested in a bioswale. Overall, site design reduces storm runoff by 40% over preconstruction conditions.

Building materials were selected to minimize life-cycle impacts and provide light and airy interiors free of formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds. Buildings feature durable, recycled content cement-fiber shingles and metal roofs. The new building’s red cedar cladding and Alaskan yellow cedar sunscreens and entrances are regionally harvested. Slatted wood ceilings are locally sourced white pine. The existing community hall’s oak floor was reused. Over 75% of the wood is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.

Text description provided by the architects. The style made famous by E. E. Roberts, Alfred Caldwell and Frank Lloyd Wright nearly a century ago was defined by a layering of horizontal planes inspired by the linear horizon of the native prairie landscape.

Asked to design Bellevue Medical Center in the prairie style, HDR Architecture posed the question “what would Frank do today?” Surely he wouldn’t conform to a style that was progressive 100 years ago.

The team did and established a modern progressive discipline that was based on simple rectilinear forms. This modern assembly served as a kit of parts that helped establish a vocabulary which defined a language, allowing the team to create a holistic building that communicated from the inside out and the outside in. Common materials such as grasses, woods and metals travel from exterior to interior, creating a seamless progression from the prairie, to the building skin, to the interior environment.

The setting is the Nebraska Prairie. Surrounded by the community of Bellevue, the building speaks not only to the people of the region, but also caters to the roots of the prairie. Swaying grasses, aged trees and a strong horizon set the stage for a progressive building that begins the new prairie school of the plains.

Text description provided by the architects. The primary design concept for the renovation and extension of the County Hospital in Hameln involved creating a new “backbone” to connect the old and new buildings. The individual functions in both the old and new buildings are linked to this distribution point that runs horizontally as well as vertically. As a new main artery, the backbone takes the existing route intersections into account in the various parts of the building and also facilitates orientation within it. At the intersection between the existing building and the extension, the various traffic flows merge into a two-story main entrance hall. A sheer glazed, continuous façade that covers both floors underlines the special significance of this new foyer.
Save this picture!
A new interior courtyard was inserted into the existing structure, and the adjoining rooms are being substantially upgraded with improved lighting. The wards are located within pavilion structures. Two small wards can be observed from each of the adjoining central nursing stations. While the patients’ rooms look onto the River Weser or the patients’ garden, the day rooms face into the interior courtyard of the pavilions. The clarity of the internal layout is also reflected in the façade: the material surfaces have been left in their natural state. Special emphasis is given to the original character of the surfaces in terms of their texture, structural quality, and individual color. 
Save this picture!
To create a comfortable ambiance in the nursing areas especially, these façades are composed of full-length ceramic elements with timber-frame and aluminum windows. The patients’ rooms are shaded by individually operated, motorized sliding frames with a stainless steel wire-mesh filling. The treatment wing also has a façade of ceramic elements with ribbon windows. Interior courtyards, with their post-and-beam façade made from light metal, expose the adjoining hallways and rooms down to basement level to natural light.

Text description provided by the architects. The newly constructed dormitory for the University of Heidelberg is situated in a prominent position on the banks of the Neckar, in the area known as the Neuenheimer Feld. Friendly, communal accommodation has been created for 194 students in an area characterized by solitary elevations and separately arranged structures.

Two terraced units, each with three or four stories, merge to form a compact residential complex: One wing anchors the structure and provides an architectural finish. The second part, with its meandering, folded composition, creates a spatial connection to the buildings of a neighboring residence. The arrangement of both components of the building creates two separate courtyards, with views of the surrounding scenery, including the adjacent bank of the Neckar.

The central courtyard is not only an access area, but also a common venue, meeting place and public square that faces the river. It imparts a communicative character to the dormitory and forms the focal point of the entire complex. The recreational areas of the dormitory, such as music and common rooms, café and kitchenette, are located here. The two central stairwells and the arcades that look out on to the open areas allow for quicker access to the residential units, which primarily consist of single apartments.

The principle of folding is a distinctive architectural strategy: In the first instance it creates spaces, which are then brought together in a stacked, coherent ensemble. This principle of folding can also clearly be seen in the design of the façade. A seemingly unending band, folded horizontally as well as vertically, playfully generates open and closed structures.

Text description provided by the architects. The new Tokyo flagship building for Marc Jacobs Collection was designed by Jaklitsch/Gardner Architects and located on Omotesando-dori in the Aoyama shopping district. The building is the first ground-up store for the Marc Jacobs brand and will give Marc Jacobs a distinctive presence in this neighborhood of luxury stores. The design is a response to the immediate context, which is bordered by world-renowned architecture and a quiet residential neighborhood, and the desire to represent the tradition of craft that is inherent in Japanese construction.

The three-story building is approximately 2,800 square feet, including two main sales floors and a lower-level space with a small sales area and storage. Because zoning requirements limited the occupiable building height to two above-grade floors, the architects employed a common building element known as a kosakubutsu to double the visual height of the building. The kosakubutsu sits above the building’s official “shadow line” – a distinct and continuous break required between the occupiable building and additional structure.

The building façade is conceptually striated into three horizontal zones; a void, rock and lantern. The ground floor “void” houses accessories and is completely transparent and visually open to the street. Women’s ready-to-wear is housed in the more private “rock” – a solid form clad in striated terra-cotta – and the “lantern,” or kosakubutsu, serves as a beacon and sign for the building. The lower level houses men’s ready-to-wear and accessories.

Jaklitsch/Gardner Architects strategy for the interiors of the building was to simultaneously extend the design notes that run consistently throughout most of the Marc Jacobs stores internationally, while making them special to their Aoyama context. At the ground level, the goal was to have no visual interruption between the street and store’s interior. A continuous water-glass façade blurs the distinction between inside and out. The Zimbabwe granite that covers the entire first floor extends out to street, forming the sidewalk in front of the building. The black-and-white color palette on the first floor relates to the building’s “rock and lantern” exterior. Top-lit, white Corian shelving lines two of the three walls, and mirrored glass at the top and bottom of the shelves provide a visual draw from the street. A circular glass and polished steel cash wrap houses accessories behind glass with a white gradient that lends a misty, ethereal quality. On the far wall, floor-to-ceiling polished steel and glass vitrines house two aquariums and border the stairway, which is made of dark East Indian laurel wood.

The second level is more consistent with design features of other Marc Jacobs Collection stores, and has a distinctly intimate feel. Sycamore shelving and custom seating by Christian Liaigre lend to the living room quality, while custom pendant lighting fixtures of hand-blown black and clear glass, and mirrored dressing room doors add light to the space. The lower level is the smallest of the three spaces, and is the “cocoon” of the building. The walls and shelving are wrapped in sycamore, and the architects designed a geometric-patterned glass and polished brass screen that separates the space from the stairway and lends visual interest.

Text description provided by the architects. The proposed project responds to the described situation with a linear building structure along the Sensengasse and a free-standing, “point-house” positioned in an extended park.
Save this picture!
The linear construction, composed of three connected individual buildings, creates a membrane-like break between the park area and the urban space. In doing so, particular attention has been paid to permeability with paths and visual connections in the direction of the park on the one hand and the partly two-floor ground floor area forms part of the open urban space.
Save this picture!
These spaces with their views upon the surrounding greenery create a “green break” in association with the untouched and completely preserved tree avenue in the Sensengasse which fuse the façade of the garden and the airy opening of the “vertical green” together with the park to form one organic whole. The row of trees along the Sensengasse is taken up into the arrangement of the individual structures, so that the project reacts with sensitivity to the existing tree stock. The green area does not end at the perimeter of the property. Instead, it interweaves with the planted greenery of the old hospital, the sports ground and the school.
Save this picture!
Through the combination of a sensible development together with an eventful layout of paths through the area, it was possible to maintain the quality of this urban recreational area. The free-standing point house marks the construction’s boundary to the northwest and stands, as a result of the now clearly defined park perimeter, literally in the middle of greenery.

Evgeny Didorenko shared with us his project whose aim of a landmark was not to create a monument to the power of the industrial age and conquest of nature, but rather a monument to nature. Doing so would acknowledge the generous gifts nature has given us that was produced centuries and even millenniums ago. Brown coal – one of it’s gifts. More images and architect’s description after the break.

More images and architect’s description after the break.PEP – piece of earthen pie. A piece of earth cake. A cake, we eat it. It is big, useful, tasty. This is, in my opinion, a very good synonym for the mining industry and in particular for the production of brown coal, which still is one of the main unsustainable energy sources on the planet. But the general trend is ok, mankind refuses unsustainable energy sources, in favor to use ecologically safe, renewable, sustainable such as solar, wind, geothermal energy etc. This is the problem of reclamation of former industrial areas. Particular example – the former coalfields. PEP – piece of earthen pie. A piece of earth cake. A cake, we eat it. It is big, useful, tasty.

And this cut shows the local energy resources – brown coal. Memory and tribute. Landmark is the piece of the upper layer of the lithosphere, which is typical for these places. And this cut shows the local energy resources – brown coal.Despite the fact that the landmark seems to be like a museum exhibit on the open air, it is still an energy source! Inside it is an uncapped pipe, opened to the air at the ends. Because of the pressure difference at the bottom and top of the pipe there is wind upward, which is successfully used by wind turbines, installed in the pipe. This energy will be enough for lightning of the tower all the year round. Despite the fact that the landmark seems to be like a museum exhibit on the open air, it is still an energy source!

On the whole height of the tower there are several viewing windows in the form of «cheese holes», and it is also an allegory for the impaired eco and bio systems of the site.

Text description provided by the architects. We began by looking at the possibilities of plaster, but soon became intrigued by the parquetry floors one sees throughout Paris. We wanted to explore inhabiting the space with one material, used in one encompassing way. We envisaged using cut wood in such a fashion that it covered the floor, walls and ceiling, lending a cohesive texture and warmth to the room.

The wood of choice for this store is Victorian Ash, a timber grown in renewable forests across Australia. The wood was cut in a factory in Melbourne’s inner-city suburb Richmond, then each of the approximately 3500 pieces was hand-cut, hand-sanded, sealed and numbered according to meticulously drafted plans before being strategically packed in shipping crates.

Eero Saarinen’s decommissioned TWA Terminal has been slated for conversion into a boutique hotel. It seems as though the Port Authority’s plan is to use the landmark terminal as the gateway to a separate hotel building that will be squeezed into the crescent of space between Saarinen’s building and JetBlue’s Terminal 5. Along with this proposal, some might think that creating a boutique out of a classic could contradict what Saarinen had in mind.

But whomever is chosen as architect to remake the space and build the adjacent new building will have some serious challenges, and those of us who are fans of the terminal, and believe in preservation, are going to need to be on our guard, since this is indeed one of architecture’s classic works.

Will there be some alteration to the tubes that once led to the satelite gates and now attach (uselessly) to Terminal 5? And what becomes of the enormous window onto the tarmac that was once the focus of the entire building? That window now looks onto JFK’s access road, and would presumably, in the future, look out onto the basement of the new hotel building.

Text description provided by the architects. The Eleanor Roosevelt College, an undergraduate campus at University of California San Diego, creates a home for a college which had previously been spread throughout the campus, lacking a cohesive unity. Located on eleven acres overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Salk Institute, the site drops over seventy feet to the west, ending at a busy boulevard, North Torrey Pines Road. The site is bound on the east by Ridge Walk, one of the University’s primary pedestrian thoroughfares, while Scholars Drive, a primary bus route, cuts the site in two. Shielding the campus from the traffic to the west, connecting to Ridge Walk on the east and overcoming the division caused by Scholars Drive were among the primary planning concerns.

The 450,000 square foot college includes residence halls, apartments, dining and meeting facilities, student lounges, academic offices, computer labs and a five-level parking garage for 1,000 cars. The college is organized around a series of large outdoor spaces, terraces and promenades that define the character of the project and take advantage of San Diego’s mild climate. Main entry points to the campus are the Ridge Walk, on the northeast corner, and at the Great Hall on the southern edge. The west side of the campus is organized around the Green, a large expanse of lawn intended as the campus’ main outdoor congregating area. The Green acts as the heart of the campus, anchored on the north by the Dining Hall and flanked by residence halls and apartments. Similarly flanked by housing with overhead apartment bridges, the Promenade is the organizational element of the east side of the campus and culminates in the Great Hall on one end and Provost complex on the other. A pedestrian bridge over Scholars Drive and a series of ramping and stepped walkways extending downhill through the site weave the two sides of the campus together. To preserve the site’s panoramic ocean views, buildings do not exceed four stories and step down the sloping site, and the parking garage is sunken.

The housing, which is all wood frame construction, includes space for 450 students in residence halls and 740 students in apartments, with a variety of unit types available including flats and townhouses. The Residence Halls are made up of 4-story buildings which flank the Green. They are a mixture of single and double occupancy rooms that are grouped into suites of 11 students, each of which has its own kitchen and living area with a west facing terrace. The apartments, in suites of 4 students, include sizeable kitchens and living rooms; the lower levels with sunken gardens and upper levels with terraces. Housing units typically face onto public plazas and courtyards to encourage interaction between residents, and create a sense of community within the campus.

The College’s overall linear and formal organization utilizes gentle sweeping curves which allow views to gradually unfold, creating movement and a continued interaction between the indoors and outdoors. Its diverse outdoor spaces, including gardens, courtyards and pedestrian streets, are used to establish a hierarchy that gives this College a village-like quality and allows for formal and informal interaction to occur. This hierarchy is shared by both the indoor and outdoor areas; private indoor rooms relate to smaller, more intimate gardens while the larger public buildings share vast common outdoor expanses. This interaction of spaces expands living areas and fosters a sense of community for the students.

Text description provided by the architects. The Gran Casino Costa Brava, located in the historic gardens of the Gran Hotel Monterrey in the centre of Lloret de Mar (Girona), is based on a distinctive environmental and architectural project by b720 Arquitectos, headed by Fermín Vázquez. At once practical and singular, the design of the new casino breaks with convention by approaching the complex as a unified structure that rises out of the ground. The building is divided into three clearly differentiated levels that are integrated in the surrounding environment.

The structure breaks through to the surface as a continuation of the gardens of Hotel Monterrey, which extend between the Tossa de Mar road and the hotel access road. By virtue of its configuration (largely buried beneath the ground), the casino forms an integral part of the hotel garden. At the same time, it succeeds in revitalising the south face of the Monterrey complex and enriches the urban perimeter by providing a broad zone for recreational use and services. The building thus presents a striking face to the public thoroughfare while remaining hidden – transformed into an element of the topography – from the vantage point of the hotel garden.

The way the casino emerges from beneath its green mantle and opens up to the city reflects the distinct nature of the two sides of the site (private and public) and addresses the difference in elevation between the public thoroughfare and the hotel gardens (which had to be conserved). As an extension of the existing exterior space, the landscaped roof mitigates the visual impact of the architectural complex as well as shielding the hotel from noise pollution from the road.

Functional Programme: When a major recreational facility like a casino is built, a range of services and complementary uses – including the restaurant, kitchens, car park, conference room, and slot machine area – need to be accommodated and distributed within a single building. Excellent accessibility is crucial, a large parking area must be provided, and an optimal relationship of dialogue with the immediate urban environment needs to be established. In addition to meeting these requirements, the design is based on a unitary, avant-garde image intended to convey the dynamism and emblematic character of the Gran Casino Costa Brava.

The building has three clearly differentiated levels. The casino is distributed in a number of areas within the main space on the ground floor. This floor includes the slot machine area, gaming room, nightclub, exhibition space, VIP spaces, restaurant, services (kitchens, storerooms, cloakroom, etc), and administration and security areas. The first floor houses a multifunctional space (auditorium, conference centre, municipal uses, etc) that seats a thousand people. A large foyer that opens to the exterior, service areas and the casino’s management offices are also on this level. Finally, the rooftop, which is for private hotel and casino use, extends the landscaped space by means of a green mantle planted with local species of low-maintenance shrubs and trees. Three below-ground floors are used mainly for parking (450 spaces), and for installations and subsidiary casino spaces (located on the first basement floor).

Façades and Topographic Mimicry: The inclined planes of the façades are made of integrally coloured reinforced concrete formed using tongue-and-groove pine boards. The floor that houses the multipurpose space is delimited by a series of broken concrete planes that evoke the tectonic movement of the ground from which they rise. The planes open onto a lattice structure that borders the foyer space, through a façade that confers a singular identity on the casino thanks to a system of digital lighting that extends toward the marquee. This multimedia illumination, which can reproduce moving images, comprises LED lights controlled by a centralised system and specific software that creates special light effects according to the activities taking place in the casino. This floor is also linked to the hotel gardens by an opening in the landscaped roof, a feature that facilitates the staging of outdoor events.

Interior Design: The interior design is defined by a number of strata with distinct decorative values. The floor is a continuous surface of low-pile carpeting in different colours to match the activity carried out in each area. This plane is surrounded by a background (reaching to a height of 2.1 m) covered in different fabrics with vertical bands of bronze bevelled mirrors, black glass, bronze, and terrazzo in black and sand tones. This stratum is generally bathed in light projected from above to highlight its decorative value and create the right atmosphere in each area. Above this level there is a more neutral horizontal band with large backlights that clearly demarcate the dining area and the nightclub space. Finally, hanging lighting in the gaming room makes a striking visual impact. Diffuse golden light emanates from a criss- cross structure that is the crowning decorative feature of this space.

The Gran Casino Costa Brava, located in the historic gardens of the Gran Hotel Monterrey in the centre of Lloret de Mar (Girona), is based on a distinctive environmental and architectural project by b720 Arquitectos, headed by Fermín Vázquez. At once practical and singular, the design of the new casino breaks with convention by approaching the complex as a unified structure that rises out of the ground. The building is divided into three clearly differentiated levels that are integrated in the surrounding environment.The structure breaks through to the surface as a continuation of the gardens of Hotel Monterrey, which extend between the Tossa de Mar road and the hotel access road. By virtue of its configuration (largely buried beneath the ground), the casino forms an integral part of the hotel garden. At the same time, it succeeds in revitalising the south face of the Monterrey complex and enriches the urban perimeter by providing a broad zone for recreational use and services. The building thus presents a striking face to the public thoroughfare while remaining hidden – transformed into an element of the topography – from the vantage point of the hotel garden.The structure breaks through to the surface as a continuation of the gardens of Hotel Monterrey, which extend between the Tossa de Mar road and the hotel access road.

The building thus presents a striking face to the public thoroughfare while remaining hidden – transformed into an element of the topography – from the vantage point of the hotel garden.The way the casino emerges from beneath its green mantle and opens up to the city reflects the distinct nature of the two sides of the site (private and public) and addresses the difference in elevation between the public thoroughfare and the hotel gardens (which had to be conserved). As an extension of the existing exterior space, the landscaped roof mitigates the visual impact of the architectural complex as well as shielding the hotel from noise pollution from the road.The way the casino emerges from beneath its green mantle and opens up to the city reflects the distinct nature of the two sides of the site (private and public) and addresses the difference in elevation between the public thoroughfare and the hotel gardens (which had to be conserved). As an extension of the existing exterior space, the landscaped roof mitigates the visual impact of the architectural complex as well as shielding the hotel from noise pollution from the road.Functional Programme: When a major recreational facility like a casino is built, a range of services and complementary uses – including the restaurant, kitchens, car park, conference room, and slot machine area – need to be accommodated and distributed within a single building. Excellent accessibility is crucial, a large parking area must be provided, and an optimal relationship of dialogue with the immediate urban environment needs to be established. In addition to meeting these requirements, the design is based on a unitary, avant-garde image intended to convey the dynamism and emblematic character of the Gran Casino Costa Brava.Functional Programme: When a major recreational facility like a casino is built, a range of services and complementary uses – including the restaurant, kitchens, car park, conference room, and slot machine area – need to be accommodated and distributed within a single building.

Text description provided by the architects. Respecting the quality of the original design of the building, as well as concerns from the community, the structure has remained relatively untouched. The generating idea or theme for the design of the renovation and additions to the Fulbright Building Fayetteville Arkansas is a 'ship in a bottle', defining the juxtaposition and materiality of the new interior spaces in relation to the existing steel structural grid and a new custom glass infill storefront system that wraps the upper floor of the building.

The Fulbright Building was built in 1962 to house the Fayetteville Public Library and remained the Library’s home until the Library moved to a new facility in 2004. The 25,300 square foot building was originally designed by Fayetteville native and noted architect, Warren Seagraves. An addition to accommodate ADA requirements was built in the early 1990’s by Hailey Amirmoez Associates Architects. The building has now been converted into professional office space by Marlon Blackwell Architect.

The 1990s addition - a double height space with a stair and handicap ramp - was converted into a large conference room, with a lounge area, wrapped in continuous maple plank on the floor and lower walls and serving the building tenants as well as community groups. An acoustical ‘shroud’ clad in black zinc panels is suspended above the conference and lounge area, and fills most of its upper volume – it is a figure encased in a mostly glass room. The shadow-like zoomorphic figure of the ‘shroud’ acts as an art piece with a public presence seen through the glass from Dickson Street. Lighting on and in the ‘shroud’ at night further enhances its sculptural effect.

The new storefront wrapping the building has been subtly manipulated to play with the reading of the building. It has a seemingly random pattern of translucent and transparent glass that allows views into and from the office spaces while still providing the interior occupants controlled privacy from the street. The glass skin was used as a way to frame and present from within strategically placed accent colors on the interior office walls. These, then, register as blocks of color from the street without actually providing colored exterior building materials, and can be changed as easily as painting an interior wall. The final manipulation of the storefront is in the actual location of the glass, glazing at both front and back locations in the frame. This is a delicate articulation that provides a depth to the system which becomes apparent as you get closer to the building, adding another, more intimate dimension, in the reading of the entire building.

The upper floor of the building is full of light from the exterior glass windows and from skylights that were cut into the existing roof. The original lower floor was more basement-like, with little exterior glass due to the north and part of the east walls being retaining walls. To make the lower floor more marketable to tenants, as well as more enjoyable, holes were cut in the upper floor slab below each of the skylights and staircases dropped into them. These staircases become light wells that open up the lower floor with double height space enhancing the spatial quality of the leaseable areas. The tenant spaces are essentially organized in a vertical stacked layout, with each tenant having two levels of office space.

Two additions were added to the building during the remodel, bringing the square footage to almost 29,000 square feet. The first is a 2,040 square foot extension of the upper floor to the east. The elevated nature of this addition allows for covered parking areas below. It also created the opportunity for an exterior grand entry stair from the covered parking area and lower sidewalk to the upper floor, which acts as a spatial joint between the existing building and the new. The stair is illuminated from above by a continuous slot in the roof that allows sunlight to pour down through the steel bar grate that wraps the steel stair. The bar grate is painted a vibrant orange which enhances the intensity of the light and shadow play that occurs at the stair throughout the day.

The second addition of 1,500 square feet, known as the ‘fishbowl’, is a formerly exterior space that was once used as a drop off area by the library. It is under an existing upper floor office space. A slab was poured below and butt- glazed glass walls were installed to wrap the space on three sides to create a seemingly barrier free transition between the interior and exterior space. Adjacent to this new interior space is an exterior brick-paved courtyard which will, when completed, have a fountain and landscaping. This project was intended to revitalize and preserve the civic quality of a historically and architecturally significant Fayetteville building, while inserting a modern and dynamic office atmosphere; extending the fundamental dignity of the building and providing its past with a future.

Text description provided by the architects. Marlon Blackwell Architect were asked to design a new modern public library within the 100 year-old brick shell of a former hardware store, located on Main Street in the small town of Gentry, Arkansas.

The program includes space for a public library, a community room, and a city history and genealogy collection. There is an open lot adjacent to the library which had remained undeveloped since the city was established in the late 19th century. Here an urban pocket park is placed allowing access from Main Street and the community room. To the south of the building, a new urban plaza of grass and concrete pavers acts as a community space for events such as book fairs. An antique fire truck exhibit building along the south end of the plaza is scheduled for construction at a later date.

The existing brick structures, though of little architectural value, were greatly desired by the community to remain visually intact at the exterior. In an effort to elevate the significance of the scarred and patched buildings, they are conceived as historical artifacts. Steel and glass volumes encase existing openings, brick ornament, and selected walls at the ground and second floors. These volumes act as display cases oriented from the interior towards the city, presenting the artifacts to the public. They are intended to extend the gritty expressive character of the library with another layer of time, character, and modernity-- a new civic and urban presence for the town of Gentry.

At the front elevation a new load-bearing steel plate and glass curtain wall system activates the street and the public library with north light and integrated display shelves for books. The existing pressed metal ceiling is preserved in the library space, as well as, an existing mechanical hand lift for horse carriages. An atrium space is opened through the ceiling up to the existing skylight above. The skylight is reconstructed as a vertical glass volume - a beacon in the city.

In addition to steel and glass, finish materials include exposed brick, wood floors (existing heart pine and cherry), carpet tiles, and cherry millwork. A two story addition (rear lobby, toilet rooms and storage) at the south wall, in natural stucco finish, provides a vertical surface for flowering Clematis vines. Eventually this vertical garden wall will act as the public face of the library as one approaches from the south.

David Kohn Architects and artist Fiona Banner have been selected to design A Room for London, a temporary installation that will sit on top of the Queen Elizabeth Hall at Southbank Centre, London and be part of the London 2012 Festival. ArchDaily has been showcasing selected entries to the competition for months now and can be seen here. For more information pertaining to David Kohn Architects and Fiona Banner‘s winning entry please follow after the break. The design competition for A Room for London, which attracted entries from around 500 architects and artists from across the world, was instigated by Living Architecture, and Artangel, in association with Southbank Center. The brief was to create a room on one of the most visible sites in the British capital, where up to two people at a time could spend a unique night in an exemplary architectural landmark.The design competition for A Room for London, which attracted entries from around 500 architects and artists from across the world, was instigated by Living Architecture, and Artangel, in association with Southbank Center. The brief was to create a room on one of the most visible sites in the British capital, where up to two people at a time could spend a unique night in an exemplary architectural landmark.Kohn and Banner’s winning design is for a boat which, perched on the Queen Elizabeth Hall roof, will appear to have come to rest there, grounded, perhaps, from the retreating waters of the Thames below. From the lower and upper ‘decks’ of this beautifully crafted timber structure, there will be extraordinary views of a London panorama that stretches from Big Ben to St Paul’s cathedral.Kohn and Banner’s winning design is for a boat which, perched on the Queen Elizabeth Hall roof, will appear to have come to rest there, grounded, perhaps, from the retreating waters of the Thames below.

These ‘thinkers-in-residence’ will be invited to stay and encouraged to muse on the city at a moment in time, through writing, image-making, online postings or live webcasts from the Room itself as their own idiosyncratic entries in the logbook. Some contributions will be instantly experienced by the public; others developed slowly during the course of the year.

Contemporary society is imposing new challenges to architecture, beyond the formal experimentation that monopolizes much of its recent history. The project “Plaza Ecopolis” aims to incorporate the idea of sustainability into daily life. The main focus is therefore to create a vision of urban sustainability that facilitates the reduction of energy consumption by matters of design but that also aims at raising people’s awareness of their own consumption behaviour. The layout of the building generates a public space that can be used by the area’s residents. Another remarkable feature of the project is to consider the public space as an “open environmental classroom”, an integrated educational program for children with the goal to improve the urban environment, which among others accommodates a water purification system based on natural processes. It is ecosistema urbano’s belief that projects as “Plaza Ecopolis” are a way to impart awareness for sustainability to children who in consequence will become responsible adults.

Resources optimization – Technologies – Economy of means: Technologies implemented at Ecopolis project are helping the initial bioclimatic design approach based on minimizing the consumption of both energy and natural resources. Once consumption has been dramatically reduced, we analyze the use of active systems based on alternative energies.

A complete energy simulation study was developed by the Thermodynamics Research Group at the Industrial Engineering School of Seville. This simulation study is the key to understand the behaviour of the building and it helped to select the best location for every single constructive element, adjusting the available construction budget.

An important area of the building half-buried (50% of the building takes advantage of the land’s thermal inertia) and a large glass facade facing south (700 sqm) are basic decisions that shape the physical relationship between the building and its environment. A bioclimatic textile layer superimposed over a light steel structure is wrapping the rational concrete core of the building. This textile (partially movable, connected with sensors to sun position) is the interface between interior and exterior spaces, blurring the boundaries between private and public and extending the inner comfort to the public space.

The Ecopolis Plaza project has the highest eco-label (A grade) of Spanish law. The building extends its limits into the plaza and part of its functional processes are placed outside to make them more transparent to the public, creating a more conscious way of managing natural resources. The sewage system ends into a lagoon in front of the building where all the waste water from the building is naturally purified by macrophyte plants. All the purified water is stored under the ground within a gravel tank and it is used for all the irrigation needs of the plaza, this artificial landscape emulates a natural riverbank.

An artificial topography has been created as an enclosure and protection filter from the aggressive industrial environment, within the plaza it is easy to forget about the context and to imagine you are somewhere else, closer to nature. Ecopolis Plaza is also a demonstrative experience of economy of means applied to the field of sustainable construction, where efficiency usually means higher construction cost. The Ecopolis project cost per square meter is more than 35% less than a conventional building.

Text description provided by the architects. The Tree House, designed by Robert Potokar of Robert Potokar Architecture Office and co-designer Janez Brežnik, is a wooden play structure that is elevated without requiring nearby trees to support its weight.  The concept, originally designed in February 2008 as since been realized three times.
Save this picture!
The freestanding, self-supporting house-by-a-tree is a playhouse designed with contemporary design principles, deviating from precedents that model real houses or garden sheds.  Instead, the design was guided by the goal of creating interesting and different spatial experiences for children that inspire new forms of polay.
Save this picture!
The house is made of spruce spruce plywood, protected on the exterior by a colourless nano-varnish. The roof is covered in a roofing cardboard that shields against most kinds of unfavourable weather conditions.
Save this picture!
The furnishings are minimal and simply constructed from dowel pins that allowed children to participate in the making of their playhouse.  The tree features a permanent and retractable bench, and scattered operable openings at different heights in the walls.  The house also features a plexi-glass wall at one end that makes the house visually accessible.

'Brent Knoll' is a new house by March Studio located on the outskirts of Victoria. Despite a brief to extend an existing 1850's homestead, it became apparent that the new extension be detached. Rather than a reinterpretation of a past architecture, the resultant became a celebration of both old and new. The two freestanding structures also continue a typical farm typology, where distributed structures, such as barn, out-house, and woolshed are connected by the outdoors and exposure to the elements.'Brent Knoll' is a new house by March Studio located on the outskirts of Victoria.

Rather than a reinterpretation of a past architecture, the resultant became a celebration of both old and new. The two freestanding structures also continue a typical farm typology, where distributed structures, such as barn, out-house, and woolshed are connected by the outdoors and exposure to the elements.Obscured by a dilapidated 1920’s lean-to, the 1850's cottage was revealed and meticulously restored, later housing guest bedrooms and a library. Beyond the initial gesture to detach the two buildings, site features, climate, and client were the three driving design tools which informed the new house. The clients, insisting they were great entertainers, desired spaces where not only people could gather en masse, but also private places to escape to and repose in the late afternoon.Obscured by a dilapidated 1920’s lean-to, the 1850's cottage was revealed and meticulously restored, later housing guest bedrooms and a library. Beyond the initial gesture to detach the two buildings, site features, climate, and client were the three driving design tools which informed the new house. The clients, insisting they were great entertainers, desired spaces where not only people could gather en masse, but also private places to escape to and repose in the late afternoon.The solution was to weave the new building through the site; twisting and turning where necessary, to create a variety of different internal and external environments. It is a modest sized addition at 230 sqm, however the resultant design provides a total of four bedrooms, two living spaces, three bathrooms, kitchen and dining; whilst outside, four new types of outdoor space are added to the existing two.The solution was to weave the new building through the site; twisting and turning where necessary, to create a variety of different internal and external environments. It is a modest sized addition at 230 sqm, however the resultant design provides a total of four bedrooms, two living spaces, three bathrooms, kitchen and dining; whilst outside, four new types of outdoor space are added to the existing two.Extending a 150 year-old Cypress hedge, the gesture became a shield from the prevailing Southern weather allowing a protected Northern lawn with views down to the valley. The 'L' shaped plan of the homestead was referenced to generate a form that, while not simply mirroring the existing building, does suggest a rotational symmetry. A secluded courtyard between the two buildings is another type of space created, shaded by the homestead and ideal for the hotter months of the year.Extending a 150 year-old Cypress hedge, the gesture became a shield from the prevailing Southern weather allowing a protected Northern lawn with views down to the valley.

The result of the undulating roof are spaces which soar above the valley at one end whilst plunging into the ground at the other. The interior of the project is characterized by the contrasting of these spaces, and the materials in which they are finished, at times seemingly at odds with the restrained material palette of the exterior.The clients expressed a desire for large expanses of glass; hence the living spaces are housed in a double glazed box veiled by a folded roof carefully manipulated by sun angles.

Avoiding a sterile environment of glass and concrete, the rawness of these materials offer a warm, playful interior executed with minimal detail and fuss.Internal materials and finishes, such as the pressed metal, concrete block work encrusted with resin and recycled antique advertising signs although somewhat ornate, are used in a natural unglorified state.

Text description provided by the architects. We were requested to design a space, which would be accommodating for the co-existence of businesses with very different natures - graphic designer studio, beauty consultation room, and graphic design school.  Although, restrictions such as short construction timeframe and limited budget, are becoming standard challenges we need to address now a days, on top of these, the site we were given this time was not a straight forward, rectilinear shape, but rather an irregular, difficult geometry. When we were already challenged by quite a lot of restrictions in this project, a “bonus challenge” came our way; our client, the married couple who are also business partners, have characters and interests regarding the space they were to work in, pointing to entirely opposite directions.  How can we approach this?

If we are to simplify the clients’ requests, it was probably suitable to break the site into 3 portions to respond to the required functions.  It was probably also suitable to enclose the different characters and interests into the separate rooms to resolve the conflicts between personal tastes.  However by doing so, the space as a whole may become something without character in the end, with rooms of no interaction.  Is it suitable, really?

Here we decided to give a go at designing the physical presence of “restrictions” and “opposite characters”.  We decided to form two regular spaces, boxed in by joinery units responding to the respective scales of the married couple’s businesses – “graphic design” and “beauty consultation”. We then “inserted” these two boxes into the irregular site.  By doing so, we were able to structure the zoning into the two boxes, and a third space created between the regularity of the boxes and the irregularity of the site; the third space is designated for the graphic design school and general circulation.  Furthermore, we have identified the opposite characters of the married couple, with the contrasting tones of “black” and “white”.  The third, in-between space is notionally the “grey”, which harmonizes the contrast of the boxes, whilst maintaining their individualities.

We aimed to design a space, which - rather than eliminating the characters created by difference in interests and irregularity in geometry – is accommodating for the coexistence of contrasts and irrationality.  We wish that it will become a working environment, which allows for richness in characters, by structuring the ambiguity in spatial.

In 2005, an invited international competition was announced for a design of the reclaimed area above a tunnel holding a section of the M30 ring motorway immediately adjacent to the old city centre.  The team proposed to resolve the urban situation exclusively by means of landscape architecture, and were the winning submission. The design is founded on the idea »3 + 30« – a concept which proposes dividing the 80 hectare urban development into a trilogy of initial strategic projects that establish a basic structure which then serves as a solid foundation for a number of further projects, initiated in part by the municipality as well as by private investors and residents.

A “choreography” of the tree planting with a repertoire of cuts, selection of grown characteristic trees, combined and inclined planting leads to a natural and sculptural character of the space to create a botanical monument. A variety of tests, carefully selected plants and materials, the design of a tree support with refers to the bull’s horns and the technical solutions of the structure of the substrates in the tunnel document the complex nature of this park in the city. Avenida de Portugal (realization: May 2007)   Avenida de Portugal (realization: May 2007) The Avenida is one of the most important roads into the centre of Madrid and is characterized by its impressive environs. The motorway lies at the boundary between one of the most densely-built residential quarters and the Casa de Campo – formerly the Spanish king’s hunting grounds – and from far away offers an impressive view to the historic city centre on the banks of the Manzanares. By relocating the road in a tunnel and providing underground parking for 1.000 vehicles, it was possible to convert the space into a garden, benefitting the local residents in particular. The design takes a journey to Portugal as its theme – the extension of the Avenida de Portugal leads towards Lisbon, in the process crossing a valley famous for its cherry blossoms in the otherwise extremely barren and inhospitable climate of the Estremadura. The abstraction of the cherry blossom as a design element of the park, the planting of different kinds of cherry trees to extend the period in which they flower, the reinterpretation of the Portuguese paving and the connection of the space to its surroundings has led to the creation of a popular public space.The Avenida is one of the most important roads into the centre of Madrid and is characterized by its impressive environs.

Through the infrastructure changes of the fifties the orchard was turned into a transportation hub. Contrary to the initial tendency to create a historical reconstruction, the Huerta is now a modern interpretation of the orchard. The motive of the hortus conclusus has been formed with a wide variety of fruit trees in groups, formed from skipping ranks. Fig trees, almond trees, pomegranate and more of such plantings symbolize paradise in the past. The in recent decades undertunneled river is meandering again through the room. Its source and the mouth are specially shaped. From the cave, which sets the end point of the watercourse the scene gives the viewer the image of the ensemble intact again – the combination of the elements of the Baroque city castle. As a consequence of the design there is a new entrance to the Casa de Campo that logically connects to the public space.

The system of streams is running through the park and will form in the crossings and though the topography different spaces and motifs. The different streams have their own characters. The Rio seco for example is an interpretation of the dry rivers of the Spanish landscape in which you feel the presence of the water in any season but throughout the year only the freshness of the vegetation along the riverbed and pebbles on the riverbed are visible. Botanical variety will create different atmospheres in the artificial leas and will allow a clear structuring of the spaces with high variety of different moods.

Text description provided by the architects. The ambition of the urban planning project for the old harbor zone, developed by VNF (Voies Naviguables de France) in partnership with Caisse des Dépôts and Sem Lyon Confluence, was to reinvest the docks of Lyon on the river side and its industrial patrimony, bringing together architecture and a cultural and commercial program. These docks, initially made of warehouses (la Sucrière, les Douanes, les Salins, la Capitainerie), cranes, functional elements bound to the river and its flow, mutate into a territory of experimentation in order to create a new landscape that is articulated towards the river and the surrounding hills.

The project is designed as a simple orthogonal « cube » into which a giant hole is carved, responding to necessities of light, air movement and views. This hole creates a void, piercing the building horizontally from the river side inwards and upwards through the roof terrace. The cube, next to the existing hall (the Salins building, made from three archs) highlights its autonomy. It is designed on a regular framework (29 x 33m) made of concrete pillars on 5 levels. A light façade, with seemingly random openings is completed by another façade, pierced with pixilated patterns that accompany the movement of the river. The orange color refers to lead paint, an industrial color often used for harbor zones.

In order to create the void, Jakob + MacFarlane worked with a series of volumetric perturbations, linked to the subtraction of three “conic” volumes disposed on three levels: the angle of the façade, the roof and the level of the entry. These perturbations generate spaces and relations between the building, its users, the site and the light supply, inside a common office program. The first perturbation is based on direct visual relation with the arched structure of the hall, its proximity and its buttress form. It allows to connect the two architectural elements and to create new space on a double height, protected inside the building.

A second, obviously an elliptic one, breaks the structural regularity of the pole-girder structure on four levels at the level of the façade corner that gives on the river side. This perforation, result of the encounter of two curves, establishes a diagonal relation towards the angle. It generates a huge atrium in the depth of the volume, surrounded by a series of corridors connected to the office platforms. The plan of the façade is hence shifted towards the interior, constructing a new relation to light and view, from both interior and exterior. This creates an extremely dynamic relation with the building that changes geometry according to the position of the spectator.

The tertiary platforms benefit from light and views at different levels with balconies that are accessible from each level. Each platform enjoys a new sort of conviviality through the access on the balconies and its views, creating spaces for encounter and informal exchanges.

Text description provided by the architects. Studio 804’s Sustainable Prototype is a collaboration between the well established graduate student comprehensive studio at the University of Kansas School of Architecture and Urban Planning and the 5.4.7 Arts Center in Greensburg, Kansas. The construction and delivery of The Sustainable Prototype was provided to the 5.4.7 Arts Center on the one year anniversary of the tornado that devastated Greensburg, Kansas. Although the building was developed for the long term use by the Arts Center, its immediate use as the first completed public facility serving as a beacon for the community and its ambitious rebuilding efforts was a motivating factor in its design.

Following the tornado, the Greensburg City Council passed a resolution requiring all publicly funded City buildings to be rebuilt to the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED Platinum level of certification. Although the Arts Center is not built with public funds (Studio 804 raised the bulk of the funds for the project) Studio 804 feels strongly about supporting this decision by striving for the highest possible LEED certification level and providing an example of the sustainable practices that can make this resolution a reality. On June 16th, the Sustainable Prototype became the first LEED Platinum building in the state of Kansas, as well as the first designed and built by students.

Community: Being the first permanent community building rebuilt in the town, it was important that it serve many functions. The sustainable prototype is an example to the people of the community of how building green can be accomplished in their own homes. However, the art gallery also acts as a space for meetings, parties, picnics, art classes and lectures; it is transformed into the town theatre on the weekends with movies on the lawn and, situated across from the town's main tourist attraction, it has developed the downtown to become a tourist destination point.

Text description provided by the architects. The facilities of the Bled School of Management have been expanded with a third building, constructed on the site of a smaller building, a manor from the 1920s.
Save this picture!
The new building, called Vila Mon Repos, transposes the orientation and the cube-like shape of the old manor with the addition of some displaced elements, such as the stairway and the entrance hall or vestibule on the north side, and the glass part of the gathering space or social area on the ground floor on the south-east side towards the terrace, also featuring the green roof of the lower ground floor. 
Save this picture!
The full wooden facade cladding with window openings embraces both the ground floor and the first floor of the building and passes into a glass facade on the second floor, which thus forms a displaced glass caesura between the “cube-shaped” house and the floating roof. The slight incline of the roof falls away from the lake. The lower ground floor represents the building’s plinth and looks out of the terrain on the south-east side as the roof of the large classrooms on the lower level. This roof is predominantly green and arranged as a terrace in front of the large gathering area on the ground floor. 
Save this picture!
On the lower ground floor, the manor is physically connected with Vila Mežakla via an enclosed passageway, while on the ground floor they are connected via an open passageway between the terraces and by the uniform landscape in front of the main entrances. Thus the entire complex of the three buildings is linked into an integrated entity. 
Save this picture!
The new manor transposes the wooden elements of its predecessor in a contemporary way: the mono-pitched roof has been enlarged and floats above the transparent top floor. The facade is clad with vertical cedar-wood planks; the rhythm of wooden planks of varying widths creates a playful wave in an otherwise static wooden facade.

The slight incline of the roof falls away from the lake. The lower ground floor represents the building’s plinth and looks out of the terrain on the south-east side as the roof of the large classrooms on the lower level. This roof is predominantly green and arranged as a terrace in front of the large gathering area on the ground floor.

The site of residential building; Tower Block C is located in the future building complex of the residential area Majske Poljane along the railway station in Nova Gorica. Within this phase of construction, three tower blocks will be erected along Prvomajska Street.

The architectural design of Tower Block C is derived from the competition design, as outlined in the study submitted to the competition in 2002 (which was subsequently awarded first prize in the competition) and in the adopted Decree on the Location Plan. The basic idea lies in the layering of two storeys by displacing their floor plan – the elementary square of the floor plan is moved around the vertical core thus creating overhangs on which terraces are placed. The vertical line of the residential tower is cut up and transformed into horizontal layering, providing the tower with the necessary dynamics.

The common vertical building height with a ground floor and ten storeys also includes a gallery on the ground floor, while the 10th floor houses duplex flats. The ground floor and gallery are intended for public use, for various service providers and office activities, and for grocery stores and other shops, while the upper floors are intended as flats (the tenth floor features two-storey duplex flats). The building has two basements intended for technical or maintenance facilities, storage rooms belonging to the flats and parking spaces for cars.

Text description provided by the architects. The building named 'Danube Flower' was built some thirty-five years ago to become a landmark at Belgrade waterfront. It used to house an exclusive restaurant which was a segment of a larger recreational centre accessible to the public. The project was sponsored by the communist government of the time and endorsed by then ubiquitous president J.B.Tito, who was the first guest at the restaurant on November 22nd 1973. It was a famed hangout spot until its decay in the nineties and its final closure which coincided with the start of the civil war in the country. For the period of fifteen years building was not in operation and has deteriorated considerably.

In many ways the building is particular but above all for its synthesis between architectural and structural reasoning. The main volume of the building, triangular in plan, is elevated some fifteen meters above the river and the ground level with the pedestrian esplanade. It is supported solely by the central core which contains two elevator shafts and double spiral staircase. Cantilevers are reaching out some twelve meters giving a levitating feel to the building. In addition one more structural move is crucial for seamless interaction between exterior and interior of the building. Concrete floor-slab and ceiling shell are not connected at the perimeter of the building, allowing for the continuity of the glass façade to the full extent. Uninterrupted glass strip, with the total length of 150 meters, is wrapping around the building to give constant presence of the Danube River in the interior, with sweeping views reaching far out, both upstream and downstream.

Together with the client organization, already reputed for its high-end gym and spa in the city centre, we have formulated a project brief promoting active lifestyle. We have defined the Sky Wellness concept suggesting that place should be light and spacious so that visitors should be getting an impression of entering a cloud on arrival.  In response we have opted for reflective resin floor finishes throughout and semi translucent Barrisol stretched ceiling; both aiming to expose sleek forms of Technogym training equipment in the open plan arrangement.

Originally, building was planed on the grid of 7.3m equilateral triangles which defined its organizational and structural regularity, but with the different brief now we were looking for a change. Defining moment of the new spatial expression is the ceiling. Its design is the sequence of geometric transformations and subdivision applied to the original grid. As a result, approximately 390 backlit panels with the finite variation in shape and size are suspended from the triangular steel construction.

By the time we receive the job, we found a long succession of these actions along the building's history and what we offer is a simplification exercise. We simply provide an attractive space that is capable of serving as a container for the uncertainties of the program. It was never clear how many square meters would occupy the area of afternoon coffee or the amount of books that would go on sale and how many different issues, or presentations and events of various kinds had to be on the top floor or below or evening cocktails weekend and revenue could sum up more surface than other different uses.

It follows the result. To this we add a really tight budget. We get a space that has direct reference to the New York loft and referrals to the art galleries of the early seventies. The idea was to design a site with an important legacy. It should be able to converse with the various activities that take place there and to the different types of visitors. This is a cleaning and lighting job in the very literal sense of the word. We had to expand the industrial side of this place and to file the excess of minimalism, in which it is easy to fall but we were not ready. Therefore, white paint, garage flooring, naked daylight bulbs should be complemented by an intense spatial relationship. Also a series of interrelated spaces should be developed, in order to provide a sensory experience of the visit. Should be a place of action more than for observation.

The place calls the attention of passers from the street by a large and light bare space that gives us the impression that there is sufficient height and surface to hold all you could be offered. We convey the idea of space left over; there will be far from being tightened ... Inside, continuous drift between haphazardly arranged tables and neither empty nor totally full shelves. In the back there is a more intimate and relaxed atmosphere painted in a wine colour, while a glass floor reveals a striking orange to invite to continue the journey. We are led to a basement that will serve as exhibition gallery even if it has to live with other programs.

It was also essential that the facility be environmentally sustainable.  In these two goals, the architect’s use of salvaged wood in the design wood (harvested from a deconstructed pair of auto repair garages that originally occupied the site) was crucial to achieving an image that fit with the historical and cultural flavor of Freight & Salvage from its roots in the late sixties, in its two previous venues.

The The Freight & Salvage organization was started in 1968, where despite the small size and grittiness of the initial barn-like urban warehouse venues, “The Freight” became known for top quality performers and for its welcoming, down-home environment.   To serve growing audience demand, attract even more high-profile performers, draw an increased, diverse new audience, and accommodate popular community programs, the Freight commissioned a new facility to triple audience capacity, provide state-of-the-art acoustics, theatrical lighting, practice rooms, back stage facilities including private dressing rooms and restrooms, and a café bar.

Enthusiastic reactions by client and patrons  confirms that the new building successfully achieves a creative image that supports the Freight’s mission, belying their former qualms  about the feasibility of achieving a much larger, modern, technically sophisticated venue without compromising the time-honored image of the institution.   The project’s sustainability and image goals dovetailed in the creative image largely through the use of salvaged Douglas Fir harvested from a deconstructed pair of auto repair garages that originally occupied the site.

In addition to using salvaged wood, architects preserved and renovated a 20-foot deep swath of the old auto-shop buildings’ street façade.  Thus from the moment a patron walks through the front door beneath the structurally enhanced recycled wood trusses of the preserved part of the auto shops, and into the lobby / performance lounge, on the way into the theatre itself and thereafter, the building, wood is prominent as an expression of the Freight’s traditional music heritage. Dramatic views into the wood lined theatre venue   from the second level teaching and meeting spaces and offices, provide constant visual connection with the performance space. The informal setting of the lobby for performance and discussions, as well as the open connection to the other program offerings upstairs communicate to the audience community that this is a place for the whole musician and music lover.

A challenge of designing a new 18,000 square foot home for an established arts institution is to take them to the next level while both standing on, but not diverging from, the nature of the old and much smaller facility that has been part of making the organization’s culture. The roots and heritage music industry often struggles with the risk and dilemma of a new building sanitizing the art. So the goal, and by all measures, the success of the new Freight & Salvage is that it honestly captures timeless authenticity as a home for the music.

The harvesting of lumber and trusses from the demolition process for reuse in the new theatre made sustainable use of the old building’s wood; these elements were carefully and yet naturally re-formed for the new building, and helped the architects achieve the most important aspects of the venue’s goals. The old Douglas Fir, re-used as wall slats in the auditorium (as well as performance lobby) but carefully adapted so it provides acoustic performance, and yet with its patina intact, is as modern as it is timeless.

The house chandeliers were chosen for their contemporary simplicity, historic reference, and perfect compatibility with the wood walls which as inviting to the audience as a warm living room. The rows, circulation, seating flexibility, and stage proximity are configured to make a singular music experience that is engaging and natural. Coupled with an exceptional sound system and acoustics, abetted by the absorptive wood wall system, the audience can clearly perceive the every note and word of the performers.

The sustainable design aspects of the project that contributed to LEED points towards gold certification also contribute to the creative image of the project.   Foremost among these elements are extensive use of salvaged wood trusses, lumber and other materials (such as recycled glass counters, recycled paper toilet partitions, etc.), the considerable amount of salvaged materials from the deconstructed buildings, the city’s first  “green living roof”,  and green practices during   construction.

The old Douglas Fir, re-used as wall slats in the auditorium (as well as performance lobby) but carefully adapted so it provides acoustic performance, and yet with its patina intact, is as modern as it is timeless.The house chandeliers were chosen for their contemporary simplicity, historic reference, and perfect compatibility with the wood walls which as inviting to the audience as a warm living room. The rows, circulation, seating flexibility, and stage proximity are configured to make a singular music experience that is engaging and natural. Coupled with an exceptional sound system and acoustics, abetted by the absorptive wood wall system, the audience can clearly perceive the every note and word of the performers.

The relationship of the house to the sun is critical. In a climate such as Ordos’ which experiences hot summers and cold winters, it is the architectural form which integrates the effects of the sun’s light and heat with the comfort of the occupied spaces. The house controls heat and light through two primary aspects: window placement and the solar chimney. The relationship of the house to the sun is critical. In a climate such as Ordos’ which experiences hot summers and cold winters, it is the architectural form which integrates the effects of the sun’s light and heat with the comfort of the occupied spaces. The house controls heat and light through two primary aspects: window placement and the solar chimney.In the wintertime when the sun is lower and the need for internal heat greater, the windows and skylights, oriented towards the south, west and east, allow sunlight to enter. Passive heating is achieved as the masonry walls and floors absorb the accompanying solar radiation which then is released to heat the spaces.In the wintertime when the sun is lower and the need for internal heat greater, the windows and skylights, oriented towards the south, west and east, allow sunlight to enter. Passive heating is achieved as the masonry walls and floors absorb the accompanying solar radiation which then is released to heat the spaces.In the summer, when the sun is higher and thetemperatures greater, it is more important to keep the occupied spaces cool. The deep window sills help to shade the interior spaces from the higher summer sun while still allowing in ambient light. Because heat rises, the solar chimney acts to draw hot air up and away from the occupied spaces, and the hot air is further removed through the operable skylights. Lower, cooler air is then drawn into the space at the occupancy level, further helping to cool the rooms. Furthermore, the masonry walls and floors slow and decrease the transmission of solar radiation into the interior spaces.In the summer, when the sun is higher and thetemperatures greater, it is more important to keep the occupied spaces cool.

Yet, despite decades of planning and patchwork development projects, there is no coherent vision for linking the pieces into a greater whole – visually or physically. In this context, the fundamental objective of the project is to address this deficiency by creating a consistent and legible image for the Central Waterfront, in both architectural and functional terms.The Central Waterfront, 3.5 km of Lake Ontario shoreline immediately adjacent to the downtown business district, is one of Toronto’s most valuable assets. Yet, despite decades of planning and patchwork development projects, there is no coherent vision for linking the pieces into a greater whole – visually or physically. In this context, the fundamental objective of the project is to address this deficiency by creating a consistent and legible image for the Central Waterfront, in both architectural and functional terms.In response to an innovative design competition launched by Waterfront Toronto, West 8 submitted a comprehensive vision for the Central Waterfront that produced a powerful design language with the strength and simplicity to overcome the existing visual noise and create a sense of interconnectedness and identity. Connectivity between the vitality of the city and the lake and a continuous, publicly accessible waterfront are the plan’s priorities. The plan expresses a vision for the Central Waterfront that brings a sustainable, ecologically productive “green foot” to the rich culture of the metropolis. It suggests a new coherence and continuity along the waterfront produced by four seemingly simple gestures that create a new “Multiple Waterfront”: the Primary Waterfront – a continuous water’s edge promenade with a series of pedestrian bridges, the Secondary Waterfront – a recalibrated Queens Quay Boulevard with a new urban promenade and public spaces at the heads-of-slips, the Floating Waterfront – a series of floating elements that offer new boat moorings and public spaces in relation to the lake, and the Cultures of the City – connections from Toronto’s diverse neighborhoods towards the waterfront.In response to an innovative design competition launched by Waterfront Toronto, West 8 submitted a comprehensive vision for the Central Waterfront that produced a powerful design language with the strength and simplicity to overcome the existing visual noise and create a sense of interconnectedness and identity.

Articulating the point of contact between the city and the water and providing continuous public access are key priorities. The proposal creates a waterfront that is public, diverse and expressed through a multiplicity of experiences. West 8 has completed the strategic master plan for the Central Waterfront and is currently engaged in design and implementation of various components of the plan, including the reconstruction of Queens Quay Boulevard to create a new balance between automobiles, public transportation, pedestrians and cyclists, the implementation of the first parts of streetscape for the new East Bayfront development and the construction of wavedeck public spaces at the heads of slips.Having been awarded the commission, further elaboration of this vision seeks to develop these elements, as well as the activities that can and should be sustained in the public realm.

This temporary landscape intervention was constructed to allow the public to experience the benefits of the new proposal – a prelude to the first-phase implementation of the masterplan to follow. The 10-day event also offered a chance for the design team to test practical aspects of the closure of the south side of the street and explore the feasibility of the street reconfiguration. For 10 days, traffic was replaced with bicycle lanes and a kilometer-long stretch of 12,000 red geraniums and a picnic lawn the length of almost ten football fields. A four-storey sculptural arch built with over 600 bicycles highlighted the temporary new section of the bike trail.With a desire for early action, the client, Waterfront Toronto gave West 8 the mandate to explore the potential of the design proposition for Queens Quay Boulevard in an interim project during the summer of 2006.

Responding to the current pinch-points where the streetscape meets the water’s edge, a new public space gateway is created where the city kisses the lake, inspired by the sinuous contours of the shoreline of the Canadian lakefront.Spadina, Simcoe and Rees wavedecks are the first in a series of timber structures that explore variations of a simple articulation in the change in level between Queens Quay Boulevard and Lake Ontario along the Toronto Central Waterfront.

Using a consistent palette of materials and details, the identity of each wave structure will be derived from the unique curvatures of the structure as well as the activities suggested through its form.In order to establish a coherent aesthetic for the public realm along the waterfront, the simple undulating timber wave gesture became a prototype that will be repeated at seven heads of slips with subtle variation.

The adopted option includes the reduction of four lanes of traffic (two each way) into a single dual carriage way (one lane each direction) to the north side of the right of way. The centrally located existing streetcar track will be reconstructed and extended over the full length of the street. The southern side of the street will be transformed into a tree lined recreational zone consisting of a pedestrian zone (promenade) and bicycle track, providing a missing link of the the Martin Goodman Trail (MGT) which follows the lake Ontario shoreline.The planning and design of the Queens Quay redevelopment has been a long process including two extensive EA (Environmental Assessment) processes.

No other district along the Central Waterfront has the unique position of being able to seamlessly relate itself to both the lakefront and the vibrant districts of the City of Toronto. As such, East Bayfront represents the opportunity to establishing a positive and meaningful relationship with the city and its lakefront. The water’s edge public realm is the primary component in defining this relationship.The East Bayfront precinct is the promise of Toronto’s great neighbourhoods on the Lake.

With 800 linear meters of water’s edge, the public realm of the primary waterfront is currently created, offering Torontonians and visitors alike a clear, vibrant public desitination with a variety of experiences and amenities along its length.The water’s edge route in East Bayfront is composed of two principle parts: a 10m wide granite mosaic promenade along the existing quay wall that is planted with a double-row of Maple trees, and a slightly lowered 10m wooden boardwalk. These two parts work together to ensure that a generous dimension befitting the metropolitan scale of the city and its lakefront is established. Underneath the boardwalk along the dockwall a series of storage tanks that will collect and filter stormwater from the district.The water’s edge route in East Bayfront is composed of two principle parts: a 10m wide granite mosaic promenade along the existing quay wall that is planted with a double-row of Maple trees, and a slightly lowered 10m wooden boardwalk.

The design of the Parliament Wavedeck serves two important purposes: It provides an integrated, functional part of the stormwater management system as well as a unique public space. It combines innovative geometry, careful use of materials and detailing, unique lighting effects, and integrates an exciting water treatment and aquatic habitat component within its scope. The Parliament WaveDeck introduces a form of public space new for the city of Toronto which promotes new interactions with people and the organic timber landscape — making more space for pedestrians and building the character and identity of the Central Waterfront public realm.The Parliament WaveDeck uses simple yet surprising forms to allow unique programming possibilities and interactions with both the lake, ecology, and the urban streetscape.

Text description provided by the architects. The Town Council of Parla, a municipality located some 20 kilometers south of Madrid, called a competition in 2005, in collaboration with the Madrid Institute of Architects, to build 826 housing units, distributed over a total of six plots, to be rented by young people. One of the novelties of the competition was that the municipal participation consisted only in the management of the terrains and the allottment of units to future tenants. Private companies took care of the competition expenses, construction and management of rental income. These 156 dwellings are a result of this competition, being one of the six projects awarded.

The proposal, presented in the competition under the motto 'building situations', is inspired by the situationist postulates of the 1950s, which interpreted the city from the individual experience, leaving behind purely functionalist approaches. The scheme is set forth as a playful colonization of the urban space, freeing up the ground floor plan as much as possible to create a field of activities that can vary depending on the user, the time of the day and the seasons. On this 'equipped green carpet'. tied to the surrounding urban fabric, the dwellings - which make the most of a surface of 35 useable square meters, trying to accommodate as many units as possible in the surface available - are grouped in four compact towers.

Each one of them is organized around a central space, with top light and ventilation, which favors interaction among neighbors both vertically and horizontally, guaranteeing at the same time cross ventilation on all levels. One vertical communication core serves, on each floor, five one-bedroom dwellings and one of two bedrooms. Each unit opens up to an external void - not included in the square meters demanded in the program -, which brings light, ventilation and energy into the apartments and at the same time serves as multipurpose space, which can be incorporated into the rooms to extend them, or perform independently, as a space for multiple uses. The only rooms that have a fixed location are the kitchen and bathroom, encircled by the living rooms and bedrooms, an organization that transfers a certain degree of randomness to the facade composition. With a very limited budget - below 700 euros per square meter above grade -, the four buildings are enclosed with anodized aluminum sheet measuring 18 centimeters wide, which gives them a markedly contemporary image.

Text description provided by the architects. Concept: A coffee grain that draws the space… a coffee made of coffee… The underlying concept was the geometrization of the coffee grain that draws the two volumes / spaces in the plan. The grain conquers the Coffee, perforates and draws the volumes, the walls, the ceiling. Its shadow is cast in the floor, dancing in the space. The two volumes are identical and translucent. However, they have distinct uses and furniture.

The 1st Volume (lounge space) comprehends a relax area where it is served gourmet coffee. In the 2nd volume (bar space) the public can take express coffee. The coffee grain conquers the mall gallery and spies the public space inviting the public to enjoy the Coffee.

The grain was drawn on many scales. Then, a matrix was built in the form of 3 panels (3 meters high by 1 meter of anchor) which, inverted, created a total of 6 distinct panels.All the walls where developed based in the study of the 6 panel matrix.

Double walls: It intends to reinforce the perforation of the grain and proportionate a body to the space. For this reason the walls and ceilings were duplicated. The central part of the ceiling is higher to give space a more dynamic feeling. The structure is in pine wood which is light and easy to build.  The covering of the walls, ceilings and balconies is in MDF, painted in white. The floor covering is in linoleum. The colors chosen were the white and the brown because of the association of these with the coffee fruit and the reflection of the light.

Furniture: The crockery and the tables were also drawn with detail, aesthetics and comfort attention. The furniture was covered with a unique and new material that is a derivative from the remnants of coffee.The furniture fulfills the space and appeals to sensorial feelings.

Lighting Design: The entire project was thought to create a light balance atmosphere. For that, it was used indirect light with diachronic lamps and halogens lamps in the bar. Orange leds were applied in the brand lettering.

Its shadow is cast in the floor, dancing in the space. The two volumes are identical and translucent. However, they have distinct uses and furniture. The 1st Volume (lounge space) comprehends a relax area where it is served gourmet coffee. In the 2nd volume (bar space) the public can take express coffee. The coffee grain conquers the mall gallery and spies the public space inviting the public to enjoy the Coffee.The 1st Volume (lounge space) comprehends a relax area where it is served gourmet coffee. In the 2nd volume (bar space) the public can take express coffee. The coffee grain conquers the mall gallery and spies the public space inviting the public to enjoy the Coffee.The grain was drawn on many scales. Then, a matrix was built in the form of 3 panels (3 meters high by 1 meter of anchor) which, inverted, created a total of 6 distinct panels.All the walls where developed based in the study of the 6 panel matrix.The grain was drawn on many scales.

For this reason the walls and ceilings were duplicated. The central part of the ceiling is higher to give space a more dynamic feeling. The structure is in pine wood which is light and easy to build.  The covering of the walls, ceilings and balconies is in MDF, painted in white. The floor covering is in linoleum. The colors chosen were the white and the brown because of the association of these with the coffee fruit and the reflection of the light.Double walls: It intends to reinforce the perforation of the grain and proportionate a body to the space.

Text description provided by the architects. This house, project by Progetto Arquitetura, is situated in a rich neighbourhood in Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro. Its construction has been finished in 2010. The house is developed in an “L” shape, divided in 2 blocks, the smallest one housing only leisure activities, and support for outside activities, (swimming pool’s showers, barbecue, SPA, gymnastics).
Save this picture!
On the entrance, a small patio leads the guest to the monumental 2 storeys high door. A social hall links visually and spatially both ground and first floor and impossible to miss the back garden. The architect’s main idea was to take full advantage of Rio de Janeiro’s warm climate that allows you to enjoy all year round the exterior environment. The ground floor is completely opened to the back garden mixing social areas with leisure, outside and inside, in a single environment.

The interior plan of the main house is organized into 2 floors and an underground. On the ground floor, on the right side, living room, home theatre, office (from social to more private areas – from back to entrance). On the left side, the same idea: dining room, kitchen, laundry and employees area.

On the first floor, it is located the bedrooms and a small TV room. The main axis constituted by the entrance hall divides the four children’s suites from the master suite. Finally, in the underground area, the garage, technical areas (electrical, etc), storage and cellar. The materials used on the exterior: wood (exterior wall and main door), stone on the floor and white paint for the walls. In the interiors, ground floor, stone on the floor (the same as outside) on the social areas and ceramics on the service areas. White paint on the walls and creme on the service areas.

On the 1st floor, wood on the floor, white paint for the walls and ceiling and stone in the bathrooms. For the garage, cemented floor, and ceramics on the walls (stone and white paint only in the cellar). The white tiled roof was a client’s exigency and the option for large eaves is a comfort choice, once that both rain and sun are very strong in this part of the globe. The idea of using a garden roof on the smaller block has mainly to do with aesthetical, because of the views from the bedrooms

Ten years after its completion, the reputation of the Scottish Parliament Building is finally being redefined. Among architects and the academic elite, it has long been heralded as a masterpiece of abstract modernism and perhaps the finest work of Enric Miralles' all-too-short career. For the general public, however, it was initially known mainly in infamy for being overdue, over budget, and for having its commission awarded to a non-Scottish architect. Only now is it beginning to receive the public acceptance it deserves, as the genius of the architecture emerges from the shadow cast by its mired construction process.

The desire for a Scottish parliamentary home emerged with the political resurgence of Scottish nationalism in the latter half of the twentieth century. Its mere existence was controversial, as it represented a move toward autonomous government within the United Kingdom that was not and is still not universally accepted. In 1997, a popular referendum approved the project, and a year later, a widely publicized competition was held for the job. The designs of five shortlisted architects were released to the public for their approval, and while a concept put forward by Rafael Viñoly actually won a greater share of the public support, the selection committee awarded the commission to the Spanish-Catalan architect Enric Miralles, whose design had finished in a close second.The desire for a Scottish parliamentary home emerged with the political resurgence of Scottish nationalism in the latter half of the twentieth century.

Drawing inspiration from the Scottish landscape, he borrowed the forms of upturned boats from a nearby shoreline, as well as motifs from the flower paintings of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Scotland’s architect-turned-national hero. [1] These became the basis for the massing of the building, as well as the form of the iconic canoe-shaped skylight apertures in the Garden Lobby. In addition, Miralles keenly invoked allusions to the Saltire, or the Scottish cross, in ceiling impressions and other details.

In addition, Miralles keenly invoked allusions to the Saltire, or the Scottish cross, in ceiling impressions and other details. More than a single structure, the Parliament is actually an entire campus of interconnected spaces. The debating chamber—the heart of the complex—is physically separated from the other programmatic areas, which include an office building for the MSPs, a press tower, administrative areas, and a restaurant and dining area. Tying these separate buildings together is a spectacular, sky-lit ground floor that provides continuous circulation around the site.More than a single structure, the Parliament is actually an entire campus of interconnected spaces. The debating chamber—the heart of the complex—is physically separated from the other programmatic areas, which include an office building for the MSPs, a press tower, administrative areas, and a restaurant and dining area. Tying these separate buildings together is a spectacular, sky-lit ground floor that provides continuous circulation around the site.As a work of architecture, the Parliament is an almost overwhelming sensory experience of complex shapes, materials, and structural devices. Every feature of the building is uniquely detailed, with certain themes and clear sightlines unifying the highly abstracted and seemingly random design. Soaring spaces are juxtaposed with intimate, human-sized niches that create an exciting and unpredictable maze of architectural stimuli.As a work of architecture, the Parliament is an almost overwhelming sensory experience of complex shapes, materials, and structural devices. Every feature of the building is uniquely detailed, with certain themes and clear sightlines unifying the highly abstracted and seemingly random design. Soaring spaces are juxtaposed with intimate, human-sized niches that create an exciting and unpredictable maze of architectural stimuli.There are simply no afterthoughts in the design, and the attention given to every surface, joint, and opening is remarkable, as one can tell from the inventive structures of the debating chamber ceiling or the custom-made furnishings built for nearly every room. This universal level of detail, while unfortunately the cause of high construction costs and many delays, serves to emphatically reject the establishment of spatial hierarchies; each room is as thoughtful, unique, and important as every other. The effect is striking, and the whimsical expressions of the architect achieve an impossibly difficult formal clarity amid dazzling complexity.There are simply no afterthoughts in the design, and the attention given to every surface, joint, and opening is remarkable, as one can tell from the inventive structures of the debating chamber ceiling or the custom-made furnishings built for nearly every room.

The effect is striking, and the whimsical expressions of the architect achieve an impossibly difficult formal clarity amid dazzling complexity.While the demanding architectural specifications had unfortunate scheduling and financial side effects, many of the other controversies around the construction were undeserved. An often quoted starting estimate of £40 million, used mainly by opponents of the project to disparage the £414 million final bill, was merely the estimate of a consultant for a siteless, shapeless office block of approximately the requested size. [2] The first estimate of the Miralles-designed building began at £109 million, and many of the further cost increases were the result of the ever-increasing spatial and programmatic demands of the clients. Requested office capacity more than doubled during the design phase of the project, and extravagant amenities, such as the multi-million pound media spaces, were added later as well. Unfortunately, little of this mattered in the ensuing public outcry that shrouded the building in disdain and made the Parliament into a symbol of government excess, mismanagement, and irresponsibility.While the demanding architectural specifications had unfortunate scheduling and financial side effects, many of the other controversies around the construction were undeserved.

Upon its opening, it was derided by some as an architectural travesty, eventually being ranked fourth on a poll of UK buildings the public most wanted to see demolished. [3] Interestingly, though perhaps not too surprisingly, the building’s reception in the architectural community was markedly different. Most critics instantly recognized the brilliance of the design and attempted to defend the groundbreaking project against the extreme costs and delays that threatened to overshadow it. This professional reception showed clearly in the series of major architectural awards that quickly came to the building, perhaps most notably the 2005 RIBA Stirling Prize.For some members of the media and the public, the unconventional and shocking design only made matters worse.

Instead of being a monumental building, as is the usual capital landmark, it nestles its way into the environment, an icon of organic resolution, of knitting together nature and culture into a complex union."

[4]The rift in perceptions between the architectural elite and the general public has somewhat narrowed over the years as it becomes easier to appreciate the building’s successes outside of the disastrous back story that dominated its early days. For Miralles, who tragically died of a brain tumor in 2000 without seeing its completion, the Parliament has emerged as his magnum opus. The whimsical and impulsive design remains uniquely unparalleled in the world today, and the building continues to exert tremendous influence onto the field of architecture.The rift in perceptions between the architectural elite and the general public has somewhat narrowed over the years as it becomes easier to appreciate the building’s successes outside of the disastrous back story that dominated its early days.

Text description provided by the architects. Bohouse is a scheme of 20no. Live/Work apartments for rent just north of Middlesbrough Railway Station. This area is adjacent to the Middlehaven area masterplanned by Alsop some years ago and has emerged as a successful regeneration project known as Bohozone that includes a digital business acceleration centre, Boho One, Platform Arts, artists’ studios and workshops; and has further buildings planned generating new businesses and employment in the digital media and technology sector.

The building is a long, narrow three storey block running north up Sussex Street with two ‘rooms on the roof’ adding a fourth storey with roof terraces adjacent.  There are three front doors serving stairways with apartments arranged around them resulting in an efficient net to gross area and good prospects for a social and business aspect to neighbourliness, an important factor in the briefing for the building which anticipated a ‘networking’ environment both in and around the building.

At its southern end the block forms a side to a small section of high quality public realm developed with Boho One and acting as an orientation space for Bohozone and a meeting/resting space between the town and the much anticipated Middlehaven beyond.  Each tenant is expected to have a credible and functioning business in the digital or creative sector and many will have or will develop relationships with the larger businesses in the adjacent Boho One building.

The principal skin of the whole block is blue brickwork, simply detailed to allow crisp and deliberate openings, returns and junctions.  In a number of areas this skin is cut away to the thickness of half a brick to reveal areas of bright colour accenting elevations, important areas in the building, or signalling to a wider urban area that the Bohozone is arriving and wanting to be noticed.  The palette of materials is reduced but similar to the Boho One office next door, deliberately to allow them to be seen as related but Bohouse becomes quieter than the bigger neighbour. Colour panels are Trespa and windows are aluminium framed.

Each apartment has one or two bedrooms and a dedicated work space.  This is located near the front door and is able to be opened out but remain distinct from the living area of the residence.  This fairly unique arrangement allows home working but more importantly allows a fully functioning business to employ people and entertain clients or customers comfortably without compromising living arrangements.  A high level of design input has been achieved relative to projects of this type in the area resulting in very desirable homes with work space and even in two instances roof terraces in the centre of town.  It was recognised very early in the process that to be successful this scheme had to be affordable but also stylish and suit the image of the creative sector it is trying to attract.

A large opening on to Sussex Street allows carparking behind gates in an undercroft to the rear of the building.  This provides secure parking and is treated in a similar way to other cut away sections of the building in that the whole of the undercroft walls, services and soffit are painted red imparting warmth to an otherwise hard external space.  A very limited soft landscape area forms part of the external scheme that joins to a garden terrace alongside Boho One offering another meeting space in the semi private space between the two buildings and reinforcing the connections between the two schemes.

The apartments are a key ingredient in the plan to seed a creative quarter in Middlesbrough and have generated significant interest since they were launched in September 2010. Approaching half full, one tenant has relocated from Sheffield to live and work back in their native Middlesbrough because of this facility. Bohouse is markedly different from any competitive project in Middlesbrough being a contemporary design, offering a unique mix of accommodation and allowing town centre living that is in short supply in the town.

Sustainability: Bohouse has achieved a Code Level 3 using air source heat pumps, low energy fittings and managing to achieve through compact planning many of the required spatial and utility features internally to the apartment.  Local smart metering allows a user interface with energy consumption linking use to expenditure.  The essential ethos of the scheme promotes sustainable transport use, the scheme is directly outside the rail station with good connections to the main East Coast north-south rail link, within 400m of the main bus interchange and adjacent the retail heart of the town. Within a restricted cost envelope and on a restricted and awkwardly shaped site the environmental credentials of the scheme are good.  All supplies are metered and Erimus operate a smart meter and monitoring regime that will monitor energy consumption and coach good energy management where necessary.

Bohouse is markedly different from any competitive project in Middlesbrough being a contemporary design, offering a unique mix of accommodation and allowing town centre living that is in short supply in the town.The apartments are a key ingredient in the plan to seed a creative quarter in Middlesbrough and have generated significant interest since they were launched in September 2010.

Bohouse is markedly different from any competitive project in Middlesbrough being a contemporary design, offering a unique mix of accommodation and allowing town centre living that is in short supply in the town.Sustainability: Bohouse has achieved a Code Level 3 using air source heat pumps, low energy fittings and managing to achieve through compact planning many of the required spatial and utility features internally to the apartment.  Local smart metering allows a user interface with energy consumption linking use to expenditure.  The essential ethos of the scheme promotes sustainable transport use, the scheme is directly outside the rail station with good connections to the main East Coast north-south rail link, within 400m of the main bus interchange and adjacent the retail heart of the town. Within a restricted cost envelope and on a restricted and awkwardly shaped site the environmental credentials of the scheme are good.  All supplies are metered and Erimus operate a smart meter and monitoring regime that will monitor energy consumption and coach good energy management where necessary.Sustainability: Bohouse has achieved a Code Level 3 using air source heat pumps, low energy fittings and managing to achieve through compact planning many of the required spatial and utility features internally to the apartment.

Text description provided by the architects. HHD_FUN architects, Beijing, presented a transformable temporary structure for the JNBY and COTTON USA fashion show, held in Shanghai, with an ability to take on numerous different forms. The structure hosted a list of events throughout December, including live music and corporate entertainment. The design was developed alongside the notion of the international image of JNBY and COTTON USA, and so a practical and an environmentally friendly approach was taken.
Save this picture!
Based on the formation of origami triangles, combined with the use of the latest parametric design tools and topological analysis, the unique structural design was formed. The structure can be assembled into one of many possible combinations with an ability to be easily transformed from one form to the next, or in a more fashion related term, from one pose to another. As well as being easily deconstructed for transportation or storage.
Save this picture!
The whole structure consists of 6 inter-locking components, sharing 3 varied designs. Each design was achieved from a process of continuous deformation and manipulation of one triangular surface, resulting in a shape which corresponds to the overall layout. The archways, acting as an entrance or an interlocking face, have corresponding dimensions to other archways and so increasing the number of possible overall forms.  Once fully constructed, the form can span a total sheltered area of 150m2.

Within the structure soft furnishings are laid out in a manner influencing the flow of movement through the tent. Interactive installations and laser demonstrations were installed at particular areas of the tent to create the required upbeat atmosphere.

The tent itself is created from a steel structure with a taut elastic waterproof material with translucent properties. The material, provided by COTTON USA was made from low-carbon footprint products, creating a biologically friendly installation with a major advantage of being able to be easily re-installed and re-used in the future, with a new form.

Text description provided by the architects. Oswego Community Unit School District 308 challenged DLR Group to design a new early learning center to meet the unique needs of children age three to five. The center is home to three programs: Tuition Pre-School, Preschool for All, and Special Education.  DLR Group’s design solution resulted in a pinwheel layout, having four small houses around a central core of shared facilities, including administration, a multi-purpose gymnasium and a community/parent room.

Design Solution: Each house consists of five classrooms, surrounding an open area called a “living room.” In the student’s perspective, this reduces the scale of their school to just five classrooms and a living room. These intimate, home-like, multi-functional spaces are flexible areas used for group learning and activities, and take the place of traditional hallways for maximum usable educational space which totals more than 80% of the entire building. The living room is the programmatic heart and social nerve center with visual connection to the environment. High ceilings and gable roofs provide a bright, cheery atmosphere for the children.

Design Goals: 1)Create a comfortable learning environment for young students. Focusing on children and their daily activities, each classroom has in-floor and ceiling radiant heating for improved comfort of the student. This feature also creates a warm, cozy environment.  There are both adult and child scale windows throughout the room:  glass only windows for adults, and portal windows raised just off the floor for children.  Both sets of windows begin only 16” off the ground so students of all abilities can connect with the outdoors. There are also observation windows between the living room and the classrooms, allowing the light from the gable roofs to protrude into the room. The gable roofs, high ceilings, and tall windows collectively draw light into 100% of all classrooms and 85% of the building.

2)Incorporate design elements to reduce the scale of the building for young learners. Horizontal lines create a child-friendly scale throughout the facility through color, materials and texture. Interior and exterior design elements taper off at a 9’ elevation, making the large scale building appear small to children.  Examples of these elements are drywall reglets traveling around inside spaces at 9’, entry canopies at 9’, and brick on the exterior of the building up to 9’ with a different material above.  This helps reduce the feeling of high volume spaces.

3)Address acoustics and provide sound control. Sound control is another important factor impacting teaching and learning. The District and designers met the ANSI Standard S12.60 as a response to the unique needs of the Oswego ECC children and their sensitivity to sound. Electrical boxes are staggered and partition walls made of metal studs, acoustical insulation and three layers of gypsum board are full height to keep sound from bleeding over the top of the ceiling.

Text description provided by the architects. Copenhagen's harbour is in the midst of a transformation from an industrial port and traffic junction to being the cultural and social centre of the city. The Harbour Bath has been instrumental in this evolution. It extends the adjacent park over the water by incorporating the practical needs and demands for accessibility, safety and programmatic flexibility. Rather than imitating the traditional Danish indoor swimming bath, the Harbour Bath offers an urban harbour landscape with dry-docks, piers, boat ramps, cliffs, playgrounds and pontoons. As a terraced landscape, the Harbour Bath completes the transition from land to water, making it possible for the citizens of Copenhagen to go for a swim in the middle of the city.

THE SWIMMING BATH Vs. THE BEACH People go to the Harbour Bath in the way that people go to the beach rather than the indoor swimming baths. Not necessarily to exercise, but primarily to socialize, play and enjoy the sun. This means that the water should not only be able to accommodate more interactive and playful activities than the focused (and perhaps lonesome) swimming back-and-forth, the land should also be geared towards a more accommodating and generous environment. 
Save this picture!
LAND Vs. WATER With an indoor swimming bath you have some land and have to design the pools. With the harbour, we have some water and have to design the land; a swimming bath in reverse. Since land is a factor we have influence on as architects, it is in the interface between the two that we can create desirable conditions. In a way, reinterpreting the water that is there by adding land.

CAPACITY Vs. SAFETY The Harbour Bath is free of charge, but for security reasons the lifeguards have to be able to control the amount of visitors. With the given water area, an equivalent swimming bath would be able to accommodate up to 600 people. The previous harbour bath allowed for only half of that amount. By increasing the land areas, but maintaining the water area within the security limit, we can extend the capacity to 600 by allowing people to chill in the sun while resting from the aquatic activities.

ICON The Harbour Bath will - with its location in the centre of the harbour - be a symbol of the presence of leisure and aquatic culture in the heart of the city. Visible from ‘the main land' and the nearby Langebro ("The Long Bridge"), it should exploit the possibility for being an icon of new possibilities that the reclaimed harbour offers to contemporary urban life.

LANDSCAPE Vs. HARBOURSCAPE When going to the beach or on holidays, it is usually to seek out exotic landscapes: the wide, open beach, the intimate lagoon, the rocky shore with cliffs and islands to jump from, the calm water or the big waves, the sand in the surf where the water is shallow and sand castles can be built. Rather than imitating the indoor swimming bath, the Harbour Bath offers an urban harbour landscape with dry-docks, cranes, piers, boat ramps, buoys, playgrounds and pontoons.

Text description provided by the architects. Copenhagen's harbour is in the midst of a transformation from an industrial port and traffic junction to being the cultural and social centre of the city. The Harbour Bath has been instrumental in this evolution. It extends the adjacent park over the water by incorporating the practical needs and demands for accessibility, safety and programmatic flexibility. Rather than imitating the traditional Danish indoor swimming bath, the Harbour Bath offers an urban harbour landscape with dry-docks, piers, boat ramps, cliffs, playgrounds and pontoons. As a terraced landscape, the Harbour Bath completes the transition from land to water, making it possible for the citizens of Copenhagen to go for a swim in the middle of the city.Text description provided by the architects.

THE BEACH THE SWIMMING BATH Vs. THE BEACHPeople go to the Harbour Bath in the way that people go to the beach rather than the indoor swimming baths. Not necessarily to exercise, but primarily to socialize, play and enjoy the sun. This means that the water should not only be able to accommodate more interactive and playful activities than the focused (and perhaps lonesome) swimming back-and-forth, the land should also be geared towards a more accommodating and generous environment.

WATER LAND Vs. WATERWith an indoor swimming bath you have some land and have to design the pools. With the harbour, we have some water and have to design the land; a swimming bath in reverse. Since land is a factor we have influence on as architects, it is in the interface between the two that we can create desirable conditions. In a way, reinterpreting the water that is there by adding land. With an indoor swimming bath you have some land and have to design the pools.

Text description provided by the architects. The design of this small residence on a corner lot in the City of Minneapolis was conceived as a progression of defined volumes: beginning with the public front yard, continuing with the two-story portion of the home, following with the tall volume of the living area, the enclosed garden and the garage.

A concrete wall encloses the perimeter of the private spaces at grade.  The wall provides a cast-in-place concrete finish both inside and out, with a 4” core of insulation.  This wall type is commonly used to create cast-in-place foundations but is rarely used as a finished wall system. Large openings of glass are proportioned with asymmetric sliding glass. Narrow panels of blue tinted glass emphasize the composition. Brazilian walnut at the upper floor contrasts with the concrete. Walnut floors and cabinets provide warmth throughout the interior. Despite the weight and texture of the concrete, the living space is light and vibrant.

Text description provided by the architects. The Weekend House on Lake Superior consists of two black volumes that extend toward the distant horizon.  Arranged on a platform that rests just above the ground, the home is reduced to a few essential elements, a main house and a small studio.  Designed by Julie Snow Architects it is a wood post and beam structure with a super-insulated floor, roof and walls. The presence of the lake is pervasive throughout the house. A long simple white table runs parallel to the lake. A narrow vertical tower encloses the fireplace. A row of cabinets along the north wall conceals the complexities of daily life. The house provides a serene connection to a beautiful, rugged landscape. Concealed by trees in the summer, the black boxes slip into the winter landscape of black and white tree trunks.

Hot water piping is attached to LVL’s that span the 16’ dimension of the house. After, the cavity is filled with a non-toxic expanding insulation.  Similarly, walls have 5.5” of solid insulation; the roof is similarly filled.  The narrow profile aluminum windows are argon filled.  They are supported on a steel ledge allowing the window sill and head to extend below the floor and above the ceiling, enhancing an uninterrupted connection to the exterior.  The exterior panels are back-ventilated pre-drilled Skatelite, a material designed for skate board ramps.  These diagrams were developed for a graduate architecture studio course to convey the value of understanding sequential construction and detailing in three dimensions.  The simple form of the house is precisely detailed to reduce cost, maintenance and environmental impact.

The house works with the climatic conditions along the north shore:  very cold but sunny winters, temperate long shoulder seasons, and hot summers cooled by lake breezes and cool nights. The house is heated with dual fuel boilers and in-floor hot water heat distribution. During the week the house is kept at a minimum 40º. The design employs passive heating and cooling. The black exterior, south facing glass and the black floor are so effective in passive heating that the house temperature can rise well above 70º on cold sunny winter days, even when the outdoor temperature is -30º, without raising the system’s demand temperature. Arriving late on a winter’s night the air temperature can be easily brought up to a comfortable level by building a fire in the heat circulating fireplace.  In the summer, sliding glass doors provide cool breezes off the lake, in which water temperatures rarely rise above 55º.

Concern for the water quality in the Great Lakes has resulted in the 2010 negotiation to amend The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between Canada and the US.  Winter melt runoff from the Sawtooth Mountains behind the site is filtered by patches of designated wetlands and sheet drain across the rocky, rugged shoreline ultimately reaching the lake.  The project was designed to minimally disturb the natural movement of water on the site by elevating the house just above grade. The house is built on wood piers with a small 12’ x 16’ foot print mechanical/storage space below the kitchen and bath.

Text description provided by the architects. This small rural dwelling, 100m2, is located in the corner of a field on the edge of the village of Graiguenamanagh, on a south-facing hill overlooking mount Brandon. Two boundary walls one retaining the other freestanding form a forecourt off the public road and anchor the building to the site. Set within a square footprint of 15x15m, five single storey volumes, increasing internally in width from 1 to 5m and in height from 2.1 to 2.7m in step with the landscape, descend down the hillside. The volumes are drawn apart to create a series of open ended external courtyards between the rooms of the house, potentially doubling the perceived area of accommodation. The dwelling remains closed to the road, where a recessed entrance formed out of the first volume makes a covered threshold. A doorway set between two parallel walls leads into the enfilade of rooms that in turn open to the courtyards and meadow below. 
Save this picture!
A simple, economic and unembellished palette of materials is employed to reinforce the concept of the house. Walls are rendered externally and in part internally, a polished concrete floor is used throughout extending in part into the courtyards. Iroko sliding timber screens form the intermittent glazed walls to the open side of the volumes. The roof is covered with a sedum blanket to replace the building footprint. A gravel forecourt and pathway extend around the house with a series of stepped gardens set out along the eastern edge mirroring the fall of the rooms inside and the meadow below is reinstated.

Text description provided by the architects. The Garden Library for Refugees and Migrant Workers was founded in 2010 as a social-artistic urban community project. The project sees the right to a book as a fundamental human right and a possibility of both escape and shelter from daily misfortunes.
Save this picture!
The library is located in the Levinski Park, by the Tel Aviv central bus station. The park is the place migrant workers congregate on weekends. It was important for us that the library come to the people, that those who maintain illegal immigrant status will come without fear, that the library would not have a closed door or a guard at the entrance who would check and ask questions.
Save this picture!
The library has no walls or door. It is comprised of two bookcases, which are supported by the walls of a public shelter located in the heart of the park. The taller structure contains books for the adult readers. It is transparent and illuminated from within so that, at night, the books glow in the park. Across from it is a shorter – children’s height – cabinet. The doors to the small cabinet swing down to form a parquet floor for the children to sit on and review the books.

The door of the tall cabinet, open to form a canopy that stretches above the two structures, and provides shelter from the sun and rain, protects the books and the visitors, and establishes a space for browsing, reading and social meetings. The library contains approximately 3,500 books in Mandarin Chinese, Amharic, Thai, Tagalog, Arabic, French, Spanish, Nepalese, Bengali, Hindi, Turkish, Romanian, and English. The children’s cabinet also holds books in Hebrew.

The books are not catalogued according to conventions of genre or author name, but according to the feeling they arouse. Every detail in the sorting and categorization system reflects the spirit of the library: The library is a small and parallel world: the books wander between the shelves as their readers have wandered/are wandering the world. They carry with them their emotional history. The placement of the book is not decided by popular vote, but by the last reader. Even if ten readers thought a book was amusing and the eleventh thought it was dull, the book will move to the Boring shelf – at least until the next reader weighs in.

The children’s cabinet also holds books in Hebrew.The door of the tall cabinet, open to form a canopy that stretches above the two structures, and provides shelter from the sun and rain, protects the books and the visitors, and establishes a space for browsing, reading and social meetings. The library contains approximately 3,500 books in Mandarin Chinese, Amharic, Thai, Tagalog, Arabic, French, Spanish, Nepalese, Bengali, Hindi, Turkish, Romanian, and English.

Every detail in the sorting and categorization system reflects the spirit of the library: The library is a small and parallel world: the books wander between the shelves as their readers have wandered/are wandering the world. They carry with them their emotional history. The placement of the book is not decided by popular vote, but by the last reader. Even if ten readers thought a book was amusing and the eleventh thought it was dull, the book will move to the Boring shelf – at least until the next reader weighs in.The books are not catalogued according to conventions of genre or author name, but according to the feeling they arouse.

Text description provided by the architects. The land to be used for the Candoso S. Martinho School Centre, around 8000 m2 in size, is part of the town planning study produced by the passage of the A7 motorway and subsequent reorganisation of the plan for municipal roads in that area.

The land shows visible signs of land works that were carried out there, camouflaging its original topography. As marking components, an age-old cork tree stands out in the high area of the land and a slope filled by medium-sized cork trees and oak trees, which makes the transition between the two platforms which constitute the land.

The building is established on the higher land platform delineating a central patio which develops length-wise in the East-West direction, and which involves the striking elements of the land – slope and cork tree area. The primary school classrooms as well as the pre-school rooms are turned to face South, with the covered playgrounds facing North, protected from strong winds and in completely independent spaces.

With the saving of means one of the objectives to consider, without losing sight of architectonic and constructive quality criteria and durability and conservation criteria, a building with a simple geometry was chosen, in which the proposed programme fits in a linear form and the spaces are sequential and structured in a clear way.

In terms of size the intention is that the building is essentially defined by two horizontal levels which contain it, floor slabs and covering slabs. The vertical surfaces, opaque and transparent, are given the habitual role of defining the interior/exterior relationship and the hierarchy of different spaces.

Text description provided by the architects. Placed in a constant traffic corner, in front of a shopping center access square and Sordo Madaleno's San Ignacio Church. The project plays the condition of being a building that takes control of the urban life and the best views in this sector of Mexico City, at the same time, is a private building and in a neighborhood scale that conserves the Polanco Colony character. The project is constituted by 6 luxury departments, of diverse dimensions to offer each one of them different qualities.

Formally, we look for a proposal that made few concessions to the fashion tendencies, a non-time project compromised with the time passing, a calm volumetry and modern tectonics. The spirit is a fine silversmith box, where the materials are fundamental: exposed concrete, along with metal skins and wood conform a moderate assembly. The concrete is a discreet but very expressively element in all building work. It is the one that gives form and structure to the expressive concept.

In the back part of the plot are 4 departments, one in per level formed in two volumes; the first one contains the public and service area, while the second the private areas. At the front of the building, 2 departments are interlace in 4 levels communicated by internal stairs. In the lower level has a exposed concrete living room, open to a English yard who allows to enjoy the outdoors safely and with privacy. The views toward the street are focus on catching the urban life generated in the shopping center access square.

Finally, the top of the building is constituted by plentiful terrace of more than 100 sqm completely open to Polanco skyline, enjoying one of the zone's best panoramic. The building was laboriously worked in all details in the design studio, the carrying out of all executive planes, to the development of all building work details, an interdisciplinary teamwork that included bio-climatic and illumination architects, engineers and building contractor; the result is a whole set that offers subtle signs, with sophisticated design elements. Despite these subtleties, the space qualities are convincing and appreciable to any user, in a building that is at the same level of the framework that inspired it and which greatest achievement is the satisfaction of a well planning and executed work.

Text description provided by the architects. The Old Tannery, a stout brick factory-style edifice built for the training of tanners in the 1930s, enjoys no official heritage status. However, our clients viewed it differently. Kane Construction, a building company that pursues unusual and inventive building projects, wanted their Sydney office building to reflect this interest.

The main original building is two-storeyed, with robust ironbark trabiated structure, exposed bearers, joists and timber cross bracing, and handsome oregon trusses. Next to this were a few ad hoc buildings of lesser quality, with single brick skin in very poor condition.

The brief was to use the main Tannery classroom building for offices, print room and reception, which we located on the ground and first floors, and meeting rooms, two of which we housed on a new mezzanine floor. The building also needed WCs, a kitchen and impressive foyer area, and some means of identifying the company from the street without using overt street signage. Adequate car and bicycle parking and access for the disabled were also required.

We decided to keep the main old corner building, exhibiting its sturdy craftsmanship, and to demolish the add-on sheds to make way for a new building for the main stairway, foyer, WCs and kitchen. This new part would be in a contemporary ‘landmark’ shape, but aligned with the original building, in the same scale and in strongly industrial-looking materials. It would be visually distinct from the original building so that the strong shape of each could be appreciated from the street.

The new building was conceived as a striking interlocking double wedge form, cantilevered above the remnant front brick wall of the demolished shed, and connected to the old building via a glazed slot serving as a passageway. It is a sculptural pavilion in industrial materials: concrete finished through the centre in a double height glass lining, and clad in pre-rusted weathered metal.

Text description provided by the architects. Designed by Julie Snow Architects, the U.S. Land Port of Entry is recipient of a 2011 National Institute Honor Award for Architecture. Located in Warroad, Minnesota the facility supports the mission-driven demands of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the federal agency responsible for securing the nation’s borders and promoting legal trade and travel. Conceived as a specific response to the vast open landscape along the Minnesota-Canadian border, its form reiterates the dominant horizon of the landscape while making reference to the East-West border. Inflected building forms facilitate intuitive use by visitors, the officers’ ability to survey the entire site, and vehicle access to secondary and commercial inspection areas.

The entire facility is clad in sustainably harvested cedar siding, embracing the “north-woods” identity of the region.  Vehicular inspection areas (experienced primarily from the car) and the public spaces use expanses of glass and warm, stained cedar siding to create a transparent, welcoming presence.  The exterior cedar siding is finished in a black stain, anchoring the building to its site. This strong contrast reinforces the threshold, creating a material warmth and richness in the cold winter months for officers and visitors through the port.

The port design manages a complex set of operational issues including site circulation of commercial, POV, and recreational traffic, state of the art vehicle inspection areas, holding areas, and officer training and work areas.  All while integrating the latest technologies for securing the border and meeting the demands of an energy efficient and sustainable building.  Life cycle cost analysis was used to ensure that long term cost and energy reductions were met and the project is in line to receive LEED Silver Certification. Geothermal heating and cooling, rain water capture, and daylight harvesting are among just a few of the strategies that allowed the design team to meet this certification.   In addition to meeting these programmatic and operational issues, the port must also stand as a gateway to our nation, representing the open and democratic values of transparency, dignity, fairness and humaneness of our federal government.

Text description provided by the architects. Designed by Julie Snow Architects, the U.S. Land Port of Entry is recipient of a 2011 National Institute Honor Award for Architecture. Located in Warroad, Minnesota the facility supports the mission-driven demands of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the federal agency responsible for securing the nation’s borders and promoting legal trade and travel. Conceived as a specific response to the vast open landscape along the Minnesota-Canadian border, its form reiterates the dominant horizon of the landscape while making reference to the East-West border. Inflected building forms facilitate intuitive use by visitors, the officers’ ability to survey the entire site, and vehicle access to secondary and commercial inspection areas.Text description provided by the architects.

Text description provided by the architects. Before the Robie House, Fallingwater, and the Guggenheim, Frank Lloyd Wright’s career was just beginning to take off in Oak Park, Illinois. One of the most significant projects from his early career is Unity Temple near his home and studio in Oak Park. Completed in 1908, Unity Temple was a replacement church for Unitarian Universalist Church that had burned down in 1905. 
Save this picture!
The church is poised as an important work for the Modernist movement in the early 20th Century, but it was also the foundation from which the Prairie School would originate into Wright’s architectural language.Unity Temple was not just an ordinary commission for Wright since he was a parishioner of the Unitarian Church in Oak Park.  For Wright, the church was meant to be a temple for man to worship god, which coincided with Wright’s decision to abandon the typical New England Unitarian, white steeple, architectural style for a more modern concrete aesthetic.
Save this picture!
The concrete could easily be argued to be part of Wright’s abandonment of the stark white New England style as part of a simplification and removal of traditional religious paraphanelia as a way in which to place man at the heart of the temple.

However, in reality, the churches budget was relatively low for a project of this scale, approximately $40,000. Wright’s implementation of reinforced concrete was not only for its economic feasibility, but also for its flexibility in design while also creating a lasting presence on the site.Located on a busy main street in Oak Park, Unity Temple sits as a heavy mass on the site. Because of the noise level from the street, the temple appears to be windowless save for a few clerestory windows placed in recessed parts of the facade. As with some of his later works, Unity Temple is designed as a bipartite building that locates the temple at the center of the building, which connects to a community center through a low level corridor. Even though, Wright tried to abandon the traditional values of the Unitarian Church, he still placed the temple at the heart of the building suggesting that even though the design of space can ultimately change, the values that are instilled in the space don’t have to.

Unlike the iconic buildings that Wright had designed later in the 20th Century, Unity Temple does not employ a low, horizontal profile, rather the space and volume was more important than the walls.

Throughout Wright’s architecture there is an interplay between light and dark, in the material, spatial configuration, and literal means of light. The exterior reads as heavy and opaque whereas the interior appears open and airy.  Inside the temple, the light seems to appear from nowhere flooding the space with light.

Since the windows were removed from street level, the parishioners have no view of the exterior or nature.  Wright’s response to this issue was to design stained glass that had hues of green, yellow, and brown to evoke the sense of nature within the interior.

Compared to the effects that the building creates, the temple is relatively small.  All of the seating within the temple is placed within 40 feet of the pulpit, which reinforces that sense of the community that Wright had developed as way for everyone to come together and worship.  Although, its actual size is considerably smaller than it appears, it is the light that pours in from the clerestory and skylights that open up the volume to appear as if it were much bigger than it actually is.

Throughout the building, more so the interior, every detail was designed by Wright himself.  The lighting fixtures, the tracery on the wall, stained glass, as well as the glass framing in the washrooms.  As with most of his buildings, Unity Temple is a holistic design where nothing has gone untouched or undersigned being completely rooted in Wright’s design principles.

Since 1971, Unity Temple has been considered a National Landmark that has been regarded as one of Wright’s greatest contributions to American culture.  As of 2009, it was placed on a list of most endangered historic places, which has led to an extensive restoration process to maintain the buildings original detailing while protecting it from current and future issues.

"Why not, then, build a temple, not to GOD in that way—more sentimental than sense—but build a temple to man, appropriate to his uses as a meeting place, in which to study man himself for his God's sake? A modern meeting-house and good-time place.” – Frank Lloyd Wright

Text description provided by the architects. Located on the east bank of the Seine sits one of Paris’ largest urban renewal projects, Parc Andre Citroen. As part of a competition in 1985, the former site of the Citroen automobile manufacturing plant would become a new public park that would bridge the urban and rural areas of Paris. The Citroen plant dates back to 1915; however, it was abandoned in 1970s when the company moved further outside of Paris. As part of one of the largest urbanization reclamations in history, Paris began to buy back brownfield sites, in addition renovating others, as part of a city re-beautification process.Completed in 1992, Parc Andre Citroen was not a singular design, but rather a collective of separate initiatives that converged together. During the competition, the jury was unable to decide on a clear winner, rather suggesting a collaboration of the submissions headed by Alain Provost, landscape architect.  The remaining members of the team included: Gilles Clément, Patrick Berger, Jean-François Jodry, and Jean-Paul Viguier.The main objective of the parks design was to serve as a transitional mediator between the urban and rural regions of Paris. With most of Paris being part of the urbanized central region, Parc Andre Citroen is more of transition between Paris’ epicenter and more residentially populated areas than it is between the urban and the rural. Considering that the park is trying to become that interstitial space where both the urban and rural meet, there were four themes or design strategies that Provost and his team focused on: artifice, architecture, movement, and nature.In regards to the conceptual framework, the 14 hectare site was design with both urban and rural typologies in mind by the juxtaposition of open and intimate spaces that coexist into an overall larger system. At the heart of the park is a large lawn that stretches through the center of the site from a plaza in front of two 15 meter tall green houses to the Seine.  The large lawn is intended to attract people from across the city to play, relax, and most of all enjoy the open space.To the southwest of the lawn, there is an elevated canal that has an elevated reflecting pool that is lined with granite guard stations; each a different study in solid and void that either minimizes or maximizes the enclosure as a way in which to frame specific views across the park. To the northwest, there are a series of themed gardens that take on different atmospheric qualities.  Each garden experiments with different metals, plants, states of water, sense, and even days of the week.  The gardens line the main lawn, yet are separated by a wall of shrubbery, isolating them as more intimate spaces transplanting the visitors into a specific conditional state disembodied from the urban context.

All of the gardens are linked through an above ground walkway that allows one to experience the garden from a distance, and even though they are situated along a linear sequence , each can be individually experience.Aside from the smaller intimately scaled spaces that line the main lawn, the rest if the park is out of touch with the human being, in regards to scale.  The 273 meter by 85 meter lawn is adjacent to two over embellished green houses that contain exotic and Mediterranean plants. In a compositional sense, the greenhouses provide balance to the overall site plan; however, as individual entities they embody a scale of a more urban building type.

Parc Andre Citroen is an agglomeration of strong geometric forms juxtaposed to more organic, natural elements.  The hard edges are complimented by the soft characteristics of the individual gardens.  It can be said that Parc Andre Citroen is a convergence of several scales and types that alone cannot exist compatibly within the city; however, in conjunction with one another they create a natural balance of open and intimate spaces, hard and soft, and urban and rural.

Considering that the park is trying to become that interstitial space where both the urban and rural meet, there were four themes or design strategies that Provost and his team focused on: artifice, architecture, movement, and nature.In regards to the conceptual framework, the 14 hectare site was design with both urban and rural typologies in mind by the juxtaposition of open and intimate spaces that coexist into an overall larger system. At the heart of the park is a large lawn that stretches through the center of the site from a plaza in front of two 15 meter tall green houses to the Seine.  The large lawn is intended to attract people from across the city to play, relax, and most of all enjoy the open space.In regards to the conceptual framework, the 14 hectare site was design with both urban and rural typologies in mind by the juxtaposition of open and intimate spaces that coexist into an overall larger system.

To the northwest, there are a series of themed gardens that take on different atmospheric qualities.  Each garden experiments with different metals, plants, states of water, sense, and even days of the week.  The gardens line the main lawn, yet are separated by a wall of shrubbery, isolating them as more intimate spaces transplanting the visitors into a specific conditional state disembodied from the urban context.To the southwest of the lawn, there is an elevated canal that has an elevated reflecting pool that is lined with granite guard stations; each a different study in solid and void that either minimizes or maximizes the enclosure as a way in which to frame specific views across the park.

In a compositional sense, the greenhouses provide balance to the overall site plan; however, as individual entities they embody a scale of a more urban building type.Aside from the smaller intimately scaled spaces that line the main lawn, the rest if the park is out of touch with the human being, in regards to scale.  The 273 meter by 85 meter lawn is adjacent to two over embellished green houses that contain exotic and Mediterranean plants.

Text description provided by the architects. Designed by BNIM, the 2011 AIA National Architecture Firm, the Midwest Retreat is located in rural Iowa.  The retreat was designed as a venue for both social and business gatherings. Because of this dual use, the programmatic relationships and requirements depart in subtle but important ways from that of a typical residence.

The retreat is located on a bucolic 700-acre site in the rolling hills of rural Iowa.  When originally purchased, the property contained a mix of prairie, woodland and former farmland.  With assistance from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, the owner has restored much of the fallow farmland and non-native woodlands back to its native prairie ecology.

The building is approached from the south, by way of an existing gravel drive that traverses this prairie and woodland habitat.  The retreat is sited in an existing clearing, and is surrounded by restored prairie that is allowed to grow up to the building's perimeter.  With its siting in this clearing, as well as its form and materiality, the building echoes the agrarian typologies of the region.  The building is elongated in an east/west direction in order to maximize daylight control and to highlight views of the pond to the east and the lone tree to the west.

The functional part clearly separates the social spaces in the continuously-gabled wood volume above from the support spaces in the concrete box below.  In addition to creating a clear separation of support and social spaces, locating primary gathering areas on the second floor provides access to views and increased opportunity for natural ventilation.  At the functional heart of this second floor space is a large, flexible open area bordered by three fixed functional elements:  a low kitchen, a large hearth and an antique bar previously acquired by the client.  These key components provide definition to the space and support its range of social activities.  The single bathroom on the upper level is configured in such away to allow for a high degree of openness for less private functions such as handwashing, while still allowing for enclosure of the more private elements.  Each of the two guest rooms at the west end are designed so that they may serve as a sleeping area, office space or exercise room, and as such their openness is also heightened.

In addition to proper orientation, the project uses a number of other strategies to reduce its environmental impact.  It is heated and cooled by a geothermal system, and the mechanical system is zoned to allow independent conditioning of the caretaker's unit.  Closed-cell spray foam insulation in the building envelope reduces infiltration and the need for an additional vapor barrier.  Operable windows and ceiling fans promote natural ventilation.  Eight-foot overhangs are employed at both ends to shade the low-e glass.  Reclaimed wood is used for interior and exterior cladding, and its natural preservatives ensure that exterior finish products are not required.  No finish was used on this same wood at the interior walls and ceiling.

Because the retreat will be used intermittently, low-maintenance solutions are important.  Instead of gutters, water drains directly off the roof into a French drain that runs continuously around the building's perimeter.  At the east and west ends, water flows between deck boards, through drainage slots, and down the canted concrete walls.  Mechanical inlets and outlets are protected from the weather, concealed at the top of the concrete wall behind the extension of the wood rain screen.  The concrete base, naturally-preserved wood cladding, extruded aluminum windows and metal roof all contribute to this long-life, low-maintenance strategy.

The building is organized to achieve maximum efficiency and minimum waste.  The gable is a continuous array of scissor trusses from east to west.  Walls are framed with eight-foot studs that did not require cutting.  Standard reusable concrete formwork establishes the two-foot module of the building.  The wood cladding is coordinated with this two foot module inside and out; by employing a reverse board and batten strategy, the cladding adheres to an 8” module while allowing for the use of standard 7 ¼” boards.  Space is enclosed and defined as minimally as possible, while still providing necessary programmatic separation.

Thus our strategy was to build a solid wall to each side neighbor to provide privacy where possible, while creating a central light and stair well which would funnel the sea breeze through the centre of the building. The front and rear of the building meanwhile, terrace back allowing each story to have visual or actual access to greenery.

The intention was to try to allow each roof garden provided a base for the story above allowing the layered effect to make each story feel like it was a single storey dwelling sitting in a garden.as much as we could do in the close confines of Sentosa island and with such a large building!!

Text description provided by the architects. As a consequence of the position and shape of the plot and logistical requirements for production, an L- shaped building was developed. the 240 metre long, four-aisled factory hall extends over the entire length of the plot. The hall is terminated to the east by a covered loading bay for rail and truck deliveries. To the west, the plot is bounded by the national highway which also oers access.

On this road is the “crowning feature” of the facility: a three-storey oce block. Interior access is laid out along an axis running the length of the building. Approaching from the visitors’ parking lot, one enters the facility via the main south-facing entrance and is immediately within a foyer, five metres high and featuring a reception area and bar. Adjoining this are the canteen, a presentation room, the main stairway and meeting rooms, along with direct access to a terrace by the water. Passing reception, sta can reach the oces on the upper floors or, following the axis of the building, pass through the changing rooms to the production area.

The office floors are designed as open plan areas with communication zones, along with individual, enclosed managers’ oces and meeting rooms. The atrium (with trees) and open spaces that stretch out to the full height of the building, confer an open spatial structure on the one hand whilst, on the other, creating a certain measure of distance within the oce layout. ␣e sails on the southern and western facades facing the street provide the building with the necessary shade.

Where the factory and oce areas connect, windows on all floors over a view of production activities. The vertical section of the hall is shaped by the require-ment that production work must be lit as naturally as possible. A continuous row of windows forms the striking upper feature bounding both long hall facades. Lowering the level of the two innermost aisles has allowed daylight to reach the very middle via two additional rows of windows. Cupolas in the hall roof also draw light into the interior. Furthermore, the arti␣cial lighting control system optimises energy consumption according to the level of daylight. ␣e row of windows in the lower area oers a view to the outside.

Also located in the northern aisle of the hall are high-bay racking and two additional oce areas. The structural design of the hall was guided by the need to allow cranes carrying loads of up to 80 tons to access all aisles whilst clearing all permanent installations. The static and dynamic loads arising from cranes pass via integral steel-reinforced concrete supports to the sleeve foundations. A lower-set production area, extending beyond the oce block and known as the “Spule” (“coil”), adjoins to the west of the hall. Here the perforated facade oers sucient illumination of the manual assembly areas.

Colouring of the interior follows the company’s pairing of orange and blue. Alongside these colours, which have been applied to the machines and cranes, another strong visual characteristic is the bright glued-laminated timber structure of the roof. Forming a signi␣cant proportion of the facility services and total investment, the test area is connected to the outdoor machine enclosure via a service conduit. Loading tests of motors and generators are monitored from the control room constructed from orange, fair-faced concrete.

The machine enclosure, also in orange-coloured fair-faced concrete, is a free-standing monolith devoid of windows and containing only services, there being no workplaces within. The layout of exterior features concentrates principally on the entrance area and that between the canteen and road, where there is quite a large arti␣cial lake. The remainder of the plot is occupied by sta parking, goods vehicle loading areas, an access road around the site, an underground sprinkler tank and canopies, completing the whole facility’s maximised usage of space.

Text description provided by the architects. The Media Library and Cultural centre is located in the town of Lisses, 30 kilometers to the south of Paris, in a zone developed during the period of suburban expansion undertaken in the 1970s around the French capital, an urban extension consisting of social and sports facilities, shops, housing and parking organized along a pedestrian path, the Mail de l’Ile de France. The new project was intended to replace an existing cultural and administrative centre on the same site, a building severely damaged from years of repeated acts of vandalism.

The project’s built anatomy is the result of a series of “forces” generated from its physical, political, social and technical context, and which in turn engender its spatial and built order, its materiality, and its position relative to the immediate context. Its program embodies the politico-cultural decision to house two independent and complementary entities within the same structure, the Colette Library (run by the Communauté d’agglomération d’Evry centre Essonne) and the Jean Cocteau Cultural centre (managed by Lisses), both of which would share the use of an 80-seat auditorium.

In order to accommodate the program, the proposed building’s irregular trapezoidal footprint extends to the physical limits of the site, a perimeter which is itself the result of successive modifications to the property limits. A series of functional constraints help to structure the building’s spatial order: spaces of enclosure (auditorium, offices, meeting rooms, toilets) are positioned as a series of clearly identifiable “masses” within the building envelope, which in turn generate a network of linked and fluid interstitial “cavities” containing the principal public spaces (reading rooms and consultation spaces, circulation, and exposition spaces), further unified by a continuous poured resin floor surface and a perforated plasterboard ceiling.

Light enters these cavities laterally through large-scale glazed transparent wall surfaces from the north and east, and from the south through a system of silkscreen patterned glazing. Light also enters them through a network of irregular roof openings capped with polycarbonate panels which “irrigate” the reading rooms and consultation spaces with subtle, continuously changing light conditions, not unlike that of a prairie beneath a partly cloudy sky. Natural light enters the enclosed “masses” through smaller, punched openings in their lateral walls. The building’s hybrid structural system directly from the duality of its spatial order, consisting of reinforced concrete bearing walls and a steel roof framing armature.

The library and cultural centre are joined beneath a continuous, folded zinc roof surface. These inclined folds link the various functional heights of the enclosed built masses, producing rich spatial opportunities for the resulting interior spaces.

The nature of the exterior envelope is a direct consequence of the social reality of the site. In order to impede the regular acts of vandalism (graffiti, burning and other degradation), the building is clad in a skin of perforated, galvanized and backlit steel mesh panels placed at a distance of 40cm from its exterior concrete structural walls. The ambiguous nature of this mottled, non-continuous surface allows one to perceive the materiality of the envelope in numerous ways depending upon the quality of light, one’s orientation, the season: transparent, opaque, scintillating…etc. Shatter-resistant glass, reinforced exterior steel doors and shutters complete the system of exterior protection.

The house was built on a tight budget, allowing limited use of design materials. As architects, we understood that the design concept must be implemented through the basic building elements. True enough, the unique formal play and the lively color scheme were realized by the time the structure and plaster work were complete.

The house is composed of four masses, which together create one formal unit. White shells crack open, allowing color to emerge from within, setting free the interior. Inside, as it does outside, the motif of color plays a major role, aside another key player in design – natural light.

Planning of the outdoor spaces was influenced by the site limitations as well as by the will to create diverse outdoor areas. The ground floor is supported by four different outdoor areas – a courtyard for entertainment, an entrance patio adjacent to the kitchen, a service entrance and a utility court. The professional recording studio located on the first floor enjoys a spacious roof terrace, with the benefit of an open view and good airflow in a somewhat crowded neighborhood.

Text description provided by the architects. The architects were challenged to design an affordable, modern, eco-friendly home that would sell at the same price point as a homebuilder house with comparable square footage. The result was a modular designed bar that sits on a poured-in-place concrete foundation situated within a 2 acre lot in suburban Omaha.

Most American families are living the suburban lifestyle. These suburbs are placeless and, whether on the coast or in the Midwest, the houses which comprise them look virtually identical. These houses are also marketed to give the buyers a feeling of ownership through selection of the carpet and paint colors, and occasionally the trim options for the kitchen millwork. Plan options are few and do not reflect the diversity and pace at which the contemporary American family lives. This was the architects starting point.

The architect chose to purchase a plot of land in the first sprawl ring of Omaha, Nebraska which backs up to a state nature preserve and also has a quiet creek running diagonally through it. Site planning efforts chose to favor land stewardship and density, accounting for existing drainage patterns, existing vegetation and maximizing views while maintaining privacy.

Norwegian design team, Eriksen Skajaa Architects has shared with us their urban study for the redevelopment of a former industrial site in Strusshamn, a Norwegian coastal settlement. Follow after the jump for additional images and a brief description by the architects. Strusshamn is a settlement on the southwest side of Askøy, an island outside of Bergen on the west coast of Norway, with strong ties to the ocean. The fjord was used for transport due to lack of roads and it was an important economic resource. When this changed and the car became the most important way of communication two centers developed without a clear connection to each other.Strusshamn is a settlement on the southwest side of Askøy, an island outside of Bergen on the west coast of Norway, with strong ties to the ocean. The fjord was used for transport due to lack of roads and it was an important economic resource. When this changed and the car became the most important way of communication two centers developed without a clear connection to each other.The site in Strusshamn is a former boat building factory for Viksund Boats that was bought by the municipality to make a new zoning plan to avoid heavy industry to be established in the future in the old, preserved harbour environment. In our study we are looking for a way to connect the two parts of Strusshamn. By simple means like improving and defining different surfaces, re-establishing a hidden river, and introducing public spaces of different character we redefine Strusshamn and prepare for the integration of the new development at the Viksund site.The site in Strusshamn is a former boat building factory for Viksund Boats that was bought by the municipality to make a new zoning plan to avoid heavy industry to be established in the future in the old, preserved harbour environment.

By simple means like improving and defining different surfaces, re-establishing a hidden river, and introducing public spaces of different character we redefine Strusshamn and prepare for the integration of the new development at the Viksund site.Strusshamn has a lot of different public services and mainly small-scale cultural activity. A combination of culture production and maritime culture can give Strusshamn the uniqueness that is needed to turn the place into both a good place to live and an interesting destination. We have introduced small culture ”boathouses” that will make a supplement to the housing as artist’s studios and small shops. They will provide public life and reintroduce small-scale commerce to this once so lively harbor area. The culture “boathouses” can be rented separately or combined to make larger units.Strusshamn has a lot of different public services and mainly small-scale cultural activity.

The culture “boathouses” can be rented separately or combined to make larger units.The study examines three different combinations of density and program on the site, but with a similar layout and approach to the site. The layout is based on analysis of climate and landscape with an aim to create good public spaces and buildings with access to light and the spectacular view the landscape offers. A continuous public space with piers, public spaces, a promenade and backyards attach the new development to the rest of Strusshamn. A central canal on the site connects the two parts of the site together and increases the quality of both and this way not only the houses on the waterfront have access to the qualities of the harbor environment. Towards the fjord to the south lies a large public space for the whole of Strusshamn.The study examines three different combinations of density and program on the site, but with a similar layout and approach to the site.

Small volumes that sometimes grow together and create larger units characterize the historical buildings. The buildings are close to the water and create spaces between that vary in size and quality. With those aspects in mind, the new development is a continuation and extension of the historical place, while at the same time demonstrating the possibilities of developing these kinds of sites into areas with more dense or urban structures.The new development is based on the historical buildings in Strusshamn.

The commission for a Green Tech City in Hanoi, Vietnam was recently awarded to Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill. SOM’s preliminary master plan focuses on reducing demand for non-renewable resources while integrating local traditions and utilizing the existing green urban character of Hanoi. At the heart of this new green district is a riverfront park. A series of landscaped green spaces, formed from existing agricultural water channels, would connect into this linear riverfront park creating a well connected network of public parks.The commission for a Green Tech City in Hanoi, Vietnam was recently awarded to Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill.

More information on this news after the break.Covering an area of 145 hectares, the plan integrates two existing villages with future development and provides necessary community amenities to serve a future urban population in excess of 20,000 people. The Master Plan expands and reinforces the local traditions and green urban character of Hanoi. The plan also engages and enlivens the strategic green landscape corridor envisioned at the city scale along the adjoining river and applies state-of-the-art technology in carbon emissions reduction, energy needs reduction and smart infrastructure.Covering an area of 145 hectares, the plan integrates two existing villages with future development and provides necessary community amenities to serve a future urban population in excess of 20,000 people.

The plan also engages and enlivens the strategic green landscape corridor envisioned at the city scale along the adjoining river and applies state-of-the-art technology in carbon emissions reduction, energy needs reduction and smart infrastructure.In addition to a new linear riverfront park, the Master Plan generates a series of organic, low-rise, pedestrian-friendly residential neighborhoods within the planned ‘Green Corridor’. This is balanced by a more urban and dense edge of high rise development articulating the future skyline of the district. A complete urban living environment will emerge on site, including a variety of housing types integrated with schools, healthcare clinics, sports and other public facilities. One of the key architectural features at the heart of the plan is a new Cultural Forum building animating a civic piazza, establishing an iconic meeting space for this new community and the wider population of Hanoi. This building is designed to accommodate a range of uses including an auditorium, TV studio, art gallery, mediateque, and cafés.In addition to a new linear riverfront park, the Master Plan generates a series of organic, low-rise, pedestrian-friendly residential neighborhoods within the planned ‘Green Corridor’.

This building is designed to accommodate a range of uses including an auditorium, TV studio, art gallery, mediateque, and cafés.The fragmented system of existing agricultural water channels on site is reorganized into an interconnected network of landscaped waterways. These will provide continuous bands of public green space defining intimate outdoor spaces for each neighborhood. This water system assists in managing flood control, preventing rainwater runoff into surrounding areas, filtering and cleansing grey water and providing a source for irrigating new viticulture activities. New public spaces also protect and encourage new native wildlife habitats to form. In addition to the new city riverfront park, these spaces include a linear canal park, a lake-front district, public gardens, children’s play areas, sports and recreation fields, a wetland centre and nature walks.

In addition to the new city riverfront park, these spaces include a linear canal park, a lake-front district, public gardens, children’s play areas, sports and recreation fields, a wetland centre and nature walks.The plan was informed by a rigorous process designed to optimize its environmental sustainability. Wind and solar analyses were used to determine the optimal orientation of streets and buildings in order to create comfortable urban micro-climates. These ensure the plan will harness natural environmental conditions in order to maximize comfort and minimize infrastructure requirements as well as operational energy costs. Sustainable district-wide technologies like canal water cooling, tri-generation plants, waste recycling and rainwater harvesting are integral components of the plan. While contemporary building technology is championed, the plan also promotes low-tech passive design strategies for environmentally-friendly architecture that is appropriate for the local economy and Vietnamese climate and culture.The plan was informed by a rigorous process designed to optimize its environmental sustainability.

Text description provided by the architects. The village of Povoação is located on the Archipelago of the Azores, on the southern edge of the island of S. Miguel. Protected from the sea by a slope, the building is going to occupy a plot comprised of a flat, rectangular platform already prepared and used by the Municipal Council for other outdoor sports activities. This platform was achieved by «sacrificing» the slope, imposing a cut that distorts its natural volume.

The project takes advantage of the existing cut to construct the building along its length, seeking a «fusion» between the new construction and the surrounding landscape. Its volume is fragmented and «runs», forming masses of black basalt, which correspond to the various functional groups of the programme.

The coverings are «contaminated» by the green of the surrounding fields, punctuated by skylights, which ensure natural lighting of the interior spaces. A square of basalt gives physical support to the building, defining courses and accesses around an Araucaria, whose verticality and symbolic load announce and upgrade this new public space.

Inside, the programme is organised from the competition and training tanks, maintaining basalt as the dominant element in the entire composition.

This platform was achieved by «sacrificing» the slope, imposing a cut that distorts its natural volume.The project takes advantage of the existing cut to construct the building along its length, seeking a «fusion» between the new construction and the surrounding landscape. Its volume is fragmented and «runs», forming masses of black basalt, which correspond to the various functional groups of the programme.The project takes advantage of the existing cut to construct the building along its length, seeking a «fusion» between the new construction and the surrounding landscape. Its volume is fragmented and «runs», forming masses of black basalt, which correspond to the various functional groups of the programme.The coverings are «contaminated» by the green of the surrounding fields, punctuated by skylights, which ensure natural lighting of the interior spaces. A square of basalt gives physical support to the building, defining courses and accesses around an Araucaria, whose verticality and symbolic load announce and upgrade this new public space.The coverings are «contaminated» by the green of the surrounding fields, punctuated by skylights, which ensure natural lighting of the interior spaces. A square of basalt gives physical support to the building, defining courses and accesses around an Araucaria, whose verticality and symbolic load announce and upgrade this new public space.Inside, the programme is organised from the competition and training tanks, maintaining basalt as the dominant element in the entire composition.Inside, the programme is organised from the competition and training tanks, maintaining basalt as the dominant element in the entire composition.On the upper floor, an outdoor esplanade supporting the bar looks out to sea.On the upper floor, an outdoor esplanade supporting the bar looks out to sea.You'll now receive updates based on what you follow!

The Philips Livable Cities Award has announced a shortlist of eight initiatives, narrowed down from 450 ideas received from 29 countries around the world. The eight simple solutions all share a common thread, a reasonable approach to improving the health and well-being of people living in cities. Shortlisted designs include a smart grid athletic light for city recreation in NY, design your own park competition, a shade stand in Kampala, and a moveable street park in Buenos Aires. Cast your vote for your favorite Philips Livable City by March 24th. Design Your Own Park Competition in Binghamton, USAIn many cities, neglected urban spaces are seen as unsightly and unusable areas of land. David Sloan Wilson’s shortlisted ‘Design Your Own Park Competition’ idea would turn these areas into a space Binghamton residents can use and be proud of.Shade Stand in Kampala, Uganda James Kityo’s idea involves creating 45 ‘Shade Stands’ across Uganda’s capital, Kampala, providing shelter against both the hot sun and torrential rain, and displaying post­ers about health education topics. Plaza Movil Street Park in Buenos AiresManuel Rapoport’s ‘Plaza Movil Street Park’ idea would see Buenos Aires’ streets tempo­rarily closed to traffic during weekends and public holidays, and portable playground equipment and benches used to convert them into recreational spaces.Smart Grid Athletic Light in New York City, USA Andrew Burdick’s ‘Smart Grid Athletic Light’ shortlisted idea involves modular solar or wind-powered streetlights connected to a ‘smart grid’, allowing children and sports teams to play later in the day in a well-lit and safer environment. Neighborhood Network Scheme in Abeokuta, NigeriaMichael Iyanro’s idea proposes the development of a ‘Neighborhood Network Scheme’ in Abeokuta, Nigeria, by providing access to a network of welfare services, designed to help elderly citizens live inde­pendently and more securely within their city.Rainwater Aggregation in Sana, Yemen In Sana’a, Yemen, water can quickly become scarce, posing a risk to vulnerable city residents. Sabrina Faber’s shortlisted idea of ‘Rainwater Aggregation’ addresses this problem by using existing flat rooftops to capture, filter and store water during rainy periods. iQare in Edinburgh, UKEve Hatton’s shortlisted idea, ‘iQare’, works by simplifying how elderly people in Edinburgh, UK, access the latest digital tools. Thus making it easier to remain independent, stay in touch with friends and family, and access service providers and retailers.Health Education Initiative for the Deaf in Embu, KenyaJacob Ireri has submitted an idea to address the significant challenges faced by deaf children in Embu, Kenya. His ‘Health Education Initiative for the Deaf’ aims to promote health-related information through the teaching of Kenyan Sign Language.The Philips Livable Cities Award has announced a shortlist of eight initiatives, narrowed down from 450 ideas received from 29 countries around the world.

Text description provided by the architects. With the BRIO54_H4 product line we set out to design a modern green home type that is well-suited to typical small and narrow shoreline lots and offers a clean functional layout, bright open spaces while adhering to a very tight budget. In order to offer better views and provide adequate security as well as flood resistance, the public spaces, such as the living and dining areas as well as the kitchen have been elevated and are located above the carport, storage, and utility room. The public spaces feature an open, yet intimate floor plan and with their large built-in serving areas and seating capacity for 35 people are ideal for entertaining.
Save this picture!
Important exterior design elements of the H4, aside from the Florentine stripes, are the front and rear balconies with their recessed sliding glass door walls and the exposed galvanized steel frame, which forms the large carport.
Save this picture!
The overall energy performance of the H4 has been tested and rated according to the DOE Energy Smart Home Scale, short E-scale. The H4 prototype has received a score of 49, which means that it is 51% more energy efficient than the average new home currently built in the United States. This score is due to a very tight and highly insulated building envelope, a high-efficiency heating, cooling, and ventilation system, a high efficiency instant water heater, ENERGY STAR rated appliances, WaterSense rated fixtures, as well as dimmer switches and occupancy sensors. In addition, each room offers natural cross-ventilation in order to utilize the prevalent shoreline breeze, further reducing utility costs during the interim seasons.
Save this picture!
Aside from energy efficiency it is also important to us to delivery high indoor air quality. This is achieved through an HRV-based ventilation system that ensures low humidity levels in the heating season in order to prevent condensation and the associated growth of mold and mildew. Our custom built-in cabinetry uses PureBond plywood, which features soy-based, formaldehyde-free adhesives. All finishes and paints are water-based and low emitting.
Save this picture!
The H4 delivers a comprehensive lifestyle brand down to the smallest detail; each component is carefully crafted in order to reinforce the overall design intent, an attention to detail usually limited to the high-end segment of the residential market. The built-in cabinetry is custom designed and fabricated specifically for the H4 product line. Baseboards and casings are flush, wall plates for switches and outlets are snap-on and screwless. The hardwood floor and cabinetry finishes with a sheen value as low as unfinished wood further reinforce the unique, natural, warm, yet modern character of the design.

Text description provided by the architects. V35K18 residence is located on the southern corner of an urban block comprising 18 utterly different houses. Due to its distinct design, clear materialisation and dark color the compact building forms a dominant ‘corner stone’ within the existing urban fabric. All architectural details are subordinate to this principle. The massive brick volume is detached from the adjacent neighbour building by a glazed void and the square floor-to-ceiling windows are detailed flush into the facade. The smaller but longer ‘Hilversum-format’ of the bricks allows for an surprising elegancy and noblesse, and at the same time the black color of the facade associates directly with the traditional Dutch buildings dating from the 16th, 17th and 18th century.

Functional, the residence is set up in a classical Dutch way: work related program is located on the ground floor, living on the beletage and sleeping on the upper floor. The spectacular cascade stairwell situated in the glazed void on the long side of the building, generates an overwhelming space between the public and private realm.

The entrance to the house is at a small courtyard. From this side the house gives a closed impression. The façade has the maximum height permitted and acts as the back of the house, turning it to the courtyard. From this large façade the building mass slants downwards in one line to the South West. On that side the residence has an open character due to the use of large glass windows and the creation of loggias and roof terraces.

From the house the surrounding residential neighbourhood is hardly perceived because of its orientation towards nature. Therefore there is a strong sense of privacy and openness. The outdoor spaces on the upper floors, volumes which have been lifted out of the main structure, overlook the surrounding nature as a result of the direction of the sloping roof. The many outdoor spaces on the floors also enhance the bond with the surrounding nature.

The building mass remains clearly readable as one volume by the continuous lines of the eaves/gables and facades. A high level of abstraction is achieved in the facades by the composition of accurately executed openings and the selection of only two materials for the closed surfaces.

The upper part of the building mass is cladded with dark wooden profiles while the base at ground floor level is executed with light-colored rendered finish.The abstraction is enhanced by fitting the complete sloping roof with anthracite solar panels which are well visible from the park across the water.The solar panels are a vital part of the architectural image. Due to the almost identical dark colors of the cladding and the sloping roof and the accurate detailed connections, the roof and the facades create one volume. With the seeming simplicity of form, detail, materials and colors, the house is blending into its surrounding landscape.

Chicago Children’s Museum’s mission is to create a community where play and learning connect. The museum’s primary audiences are children up through fifth grade including their families, along with school and community groups that support and influence children’s growth and development. In its current location at Navy Pier, the Museum lacks meaningful connections to the outdoors and is challenged with the heavyly commercial environment of what has become Illinois’ most popular tourist attraction.Chicago Children’s Museum’s mission is to create a community where play and learning connect.

Puerto Natales House Navimag Shearing ShedThe Project is organized around three main ideas. First: to discover the building as a voyager who experience places not at once but through continuous steps. Second: to be sensitive with the site and its provincial character and lack of "noise" .Thirdly: to radically differentiate the intimate space of the sleeping rooms from the monumental space of public areas .

With regard to the first idea, and in order to show the inner void of public spaces not at once but at fragmented glances, we proposed an inner circulation that goes from street level to upper level evolving from a soft ramp to a system of  staircases and from corridors to bridges in a way that horizontal and vertical movement become an orchestrated coreography within the building .

Regarding the second idea, and  in order to match some qualities of the context in the exterior expression of the building we used: a) Materials already present in the town such as timber and corrugated steel

b) A simple volume that occupies the all site

c) A systematic rhythm of windows

More specifically, we proposed a volume that recreates the differentiation that quiet often is seen in Puerto Natales between those front elevations that face the street and those lateral elevations that face the sides of the sites . Consequently: for street facades we used corrugated steel and for side facades we used treated pine.

With regard to the third idea, and in order to  highlight the intimacy of sleeping-rooms, we generated  an  horizontal strata made out of pine that incorporates all usable surfaces in the room such as beds, lavatories, tables and bay windows. On the contrary, public spaces are mainly vertical spaces were a huge shutter or curtain made out eucalyptus bars is always present.

Finally it is important to mention that graphic desing was worked together with architecture. Under the concept of using some iconography already present in the area we adopted the universe of maritime container an ships in general to creates signals on the facades and the interior spaces that reminds Navimag, the only ship that every Thursday arrives to Puerto Natales bringing foods and fresh news to the deep south.

INDIGO PATAGONIA Restaurant and LOUNGE In association with architect XIMENA GARCIA-HUIDOBR0, "Indigo Patagonia Restaurant and Lounge"  was finished at the beginning of January 2007. It   is located beside  "Indigo Patagonia Hotel"  in an old Patagonian house . The work done consisted in voiding the core of the house and  reinforcing the perimeter walls with a steel frame . In order to interconnect the existing two  stories we emptied the center with a "y" shape void . This void is occupied by an extended platform and staircase  that extend time of passing  from one level to another, making the exhibition of people part of the choreography of space. The restaurant is located in ground level and lounge is upstairs.

Text description provided by the architects. The Hill House is composed of a 20’ wide x 115’ long stepped platform, a shelter formed by the roof and east wall, and several gabion stone walls. It is sited on a long, narrow, rocky hillside, sloping gently to the south and steeply to the east and west. The building reads and lives like a habitable landscape, adapting to the changing seasons and needs of its occupants. In short, this is a modest, sustainable building with a big presence in a big landscape.

A light-framed, wood platform steps up the hillside and floats above it. Interior and exterior functions are delineated by a glass wall that wraps three sides of the structure. Finish materials are common throughout, blurring the line between inside and out. The result is a seasonally expansive structure, generous in summer (2200 SF), modest and efficient in winter (1100 SF).

The east wall cuts into the land like a rusty blade, evoking the cultural history of the mining encampments found in the area and providing privacy from the adjacent country road. It offers a defensive backdrop when viewed from the interior and, combined with the shelter provided by the roof, and warmth provided by the wood stove/fire pit, lends a primordial feel to the building that is unexpected in this thoroughly modern structure.

Gabion stone walls bridge between building and landscape, offering retaining, context and privacy. Construction waste was dramatically reduced by incorporating these walls, which are made from the spoils of the building’s excavations.

Sustainable materials, technologies and techniques are used throughout. Recycled steel, sustainably harvested wood, BIBS insulation in oversized wall and ceiling cavities, on-demand hot water, low-flow fixtures and convection heat are all employed. Fenestration is designed to encourage passive solar radiation in winter. In summer, roofs and walls are vented to dissipate heat, and large overhangs, combined with seasonally-deployed, exterior sun shades (made from the same fabric used to shield fruit trees on nearby orchards) protect the glass from summer sun. In addition, the building’s wedge shape and site orientation result in a solar chimney effect, encouraging natural ventilation and evaporative cooling.

Text description provided by the architects. The Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook is a 57-acre urban state park located 500 feet above the city in the heart of Los Angeles. The park includes a new 10,000 square foot visitor center, observation deck and viewing areas, hiking trails, picnic areas and restored natural landscape. The turbulent history of the Baldwin Hills site, from oil wells to plans for massive residential development, stripped this mountain of most of its natural past. A critical part of the design process was to define the period that represented the site in its natural state and to create a suitable approach to the restoration of the site. It was also important to understand the history of land development in Los Angeles in order to better understand the symbolic value of this verdant mountain in the midst of a dense city.

The principal goal of the Master Plan has been to preserve and enhance the unique qualities of this expansive site through the restoration of its natural ecosystems, creating a harmonious balance between community recreational activities and the natural systems within the site. The interpretive message of the Visitor Center is to foster environmental awareness by understanding the impact development has had on our land.

The Visitor center is tucked unobtrusively into a hollow near the summit of the park, its curving forms emulating the sculptural landforms of the site. Large polished concrete walls retain the hillside while floor to ceiling windows open the visitor center towards the landscape and expansive views of the city beyond. The center is comprised of three buildings; the first houses the exhibit space, a small theater, and meeting rooms; the second contains support spaces, bathrooms and a catering kitchen, and the third is an outdoor pavilion for special events that spills out onto an outdoor amphitheater formed from recycled concrete surrounded by landscape exhibits of native plants.

A gently climbing walkway leads visitors from the parking lot towards the Visitor Center and through the interior and exterior exhibit spaces. The path then leads past the outdoor amphitheater and through a series of engineered mounds at the top of the hill towards the overlook. The mounds have been formed to suspend the views of downtown Los Angeles until arrival at the overlook where they are dramatically revealed.

Last week, as the NY Times reported, the interior of 510 Fifth Avenue received landmark protection by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The building, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill back in the 1950s, served as a branch of the former Manufacturers Trust Bank (later the Chase Bank Building) and is situated on a dense Manhattan block near the New York Public Library, Cook+Fox’s recent One Bryant Park, and the park itself.Last week, as the NY Times reported, the interior of 510 Fifth Avenue received landmark protection by the Landmarks Preservation Commission.

Le Maire will also be protected. The building marks an important point in banking typology as Bunshaft abandoned the typical “fortress” style for a more open and transparent atmosphere.  The open plan of the building is illuminated by large windows and creates a new kind of relationship between passersby and those inside the bank.

The idea to put the vault on a public level was a strong statement against the traditional vaults which were hidden below ground.  As Postal notes, “According to the architects, aesthetics played an important role: It’s like sailors and boats. While we were designing the building, the bankers kept taking us down into bank cellars and showing us vault doors; then they would stand around looking at them, and say to each other reverently, ‘Isn’t it beautiful!” After a while we began to agree.” Another great aspect of the interior is the prominent 7 foot high, 30-ton circular main vault designed by Henry Dreyfuss.

Architects’ Week is a longstanding tradition of the Tulane School of Architecture as a weeklong, design and build, group project. It is a unique occasion for students to work not only with a proven designer, but also with fellow students. The exact form that it takes varies from year to year. In 2010, A-Week groups created information kiosks for New Orleans. The year before was an exploration in rethinking the bench. This year the project brief was a bit different. The project brief, images and descriptions of each student project and the winning design after the break.

In 2010, A-Week groups created information kiosks for New Orleans. The year before was an exploration in rethinking the bench. This year the project brief was a bit different. The project brief, images and descriptions of each student project and the winning design after the break. Instead of using the program to prescribe an end result, we gave the students a starting point. The groups were asked to create an installation based on sensory interaction. We also asked that the designs considered green options, and that they could be contained within a footprint of 64 square feet and a volume of 1,000 cubic feet. The groups were then allotted $350 each and sent to work. Instead of using the program to prescribe an end result, we gave the students a starting point.

While professors are asked to refrain from giving input, Jing Liu and her associates, all representing the firm Solid Objectives – Idenburg Liu, was kind enough to visit and act as a design consultant. With an almost unprecedented level of commitment and some fantastic help, all of the teams crossed the finish line in time for their final review. This year 8 groups competed.

In this case, the tree canopy is highlighted by connecting the overhead structure of the branches to a built path on the ground. The path is suspended in segments using a strong fishing wire, which helps to dissolve any visual indication at the vertical plane. This diffused connection leads to a soft rustling of the branches whenever someone transverses the bridge.

The Home Wrecker emphasizes these issues by utilizing once-desirable furniture. Despite the unconventional context, the viewer still recognizes the generic American living room. The installation then provokes the viewer to create their own deconstructed room by sliding each pallet, resembling the children’s tile game. During the time the project was up, students and community members were found lounging, studying, eating and enjoying the transformative properties of the space.

This project intends to both direct and interrupt this flow with canvas forms. As more people happen through the area and activate it by leaving drawings and notes, the white sails morph to take on a different guise, one that is heavily influenced by the artistic whims of the Tulane population.

Twelve panels form two constantly moving curtain walls and create fluidity of space in between. The transparency and weightlessness of the installation allows itself to play with sun, wind, and light conditions. The ephemeral project does not take any static visual, acoustical, or sensual form. Instead, the dematerialization of straws, characterized by porosity and local interconnectivity, creates a form defined by intricate intervals, repetitions, and seriality.

The form, conceived as a 12 sided truncated cone, created an enclosed space embellished with recycled cardboard tubes held in place by more than 1,300 permeated holes. The interiors of the cylinders were painted three glossy colors, while the structure was painted a matte black to create a stark contrast against the bright pinholes, which framed views of the outside world. The tubes also acted as amplifiers projecting sound outward, which created a paradox between the implied privacy of form and the realized transparency of verbal communication. At night the visual experience reverses when solar lights are activated, causing the structure to perform like a colorful beacon on the quad.

The fluid shape creates pockets of occupiable space such as benches and shelves. The form is also traversable. Sod and flowers are planted within the pallets to establish the form as an extension of the landscape. The installation works to heighten all senses by altering the visitor’s equilibrium.  Traversing the pallet divorces visitors from the ground plane and results in the experiences of joy and apprehension.

The group chose a location with a quiet bench overlooking the quad. The overhanging branch of the tree was used to structurally support the intervention. The surface was modeled in Rhino to help approximate dimensions and regions of structure. Each bottle was rinsed out and cleaned, the cap was painted, and the container filled with colored water corresponding to a gradient. The density of the bottle and the intensity of the colors formed a visual that started as a bright, contrasting red behind the bench and rose into a blue shade that melted into the sky and gestured towards the quad.

The main element, the Crash Tower, hosts a weight that can be hoisted up through a pulley system and then dropped below to a bottle. The smashed remains then filters through the hole into the storage base. Visually, the base seems to overflow onto the path, which is formed by shaping the broken pieces. Protected by a metal mesh, it is possible for a person to walk down it, feeling the parts crunch further beneath them. Afterward, the glass pieces were then given to the local glass studio as raw material. This project placed emphasis on the lives of glass bottles and a recycling process.

Text description provided by the architects. Competition Team: Gert Wingårdh, Thomas Hansen, Ulrika Davidsson, Fredrik Gullberg, Pål Ericsson, Jacob Sahlqvist, Jacek Zalecki, Petter Leyman, Ola Frödell, Henrik Schulz, Tobias Fasth, Robert Hendberg Building Team: Gert Wingårdh, Thomas Hansen, Gunilla Murnieks, Susanna Ringnér, Birgitta Stenvaller, Andreas Henriksson, Gustav Appell, Markus Furby, Björn Nilsson, Therese Ahlström, Taito Lampinen, Robert Hendberg, Daniel Frickeus, Fredrik Gullberg, Sven Nestgaard, Sara Helder, Pål Ericsson, Maria Olausson, Fredrik Prytz, Anna Palm, Hanna Samuelson, Alexandra Pripp It is hot and very humid. The architectural competition has begun. Sweden has the chance to win a spectacular site - a peninsula surrounded by the Potomac and Rock Creek. The National Swedish Property Board, with Jan Thews as its representative, has a clear goal. The city plan allows a certain volume and that has to be exploited to make the project financially reasonable. There is one drawback with this site, however - it floods regularly. What we propose to do is to create a seven-level building, including a rooftop terrace and underground parking, and to build at least to the property boundary, except at entrance level. The entrance level lies at the highest point to which the Potomac River is expected to rise. 
Save this picture!
A large flight of steps and a ramp along the entrance side of the building leave the pillars exposed and create a loggia in a classicistic and classically modern style (compare this with Villa Savoie). Here, the cars will draw up and deliver the guests arriving at the embassy. The Swedish Government has approved guidelines for how embassies should be designed and how they should act. One has to bear in mind that embassies should serve as display windows for Sweden where procedures are completely open and transparent and where exhibitions, talks and conferences are important and should be available to the general public. The entrance floor is the hub of all operations. The part of the building used exclusively for the embassy is on the left with its reception area and with offices up on the next floor. The public part of the building has its reception on the right, with a large, glazed exhibition space (the Anna Lind Hall) facing the Potomac River and with a series of multi-purpose exhibition and conference rooms leading off a lower lobby. 
Save this picture!
Never before have the public areas been allowed to take up so much room. And the building really attracts the public. There are constant streams of people moving along the banks of the Potomac. Massive sliding doors make it possible to open up the Anna Lind Hall at both corners. The public is welcome to gaze from any side through the entrance hall, where interior and exterior walls made entirely of glass provide unobstructed views. The top two floors of the building are a residential area, with 19 apartments. The two belts of balconies form a projecting box-like structure that encircles these two floors. It is built, with the consent of the authorities, out over the building rights, as is the northern escape stairs and the rooftop terrace's ‘glass fins' containing tops of the elevators, fans, restrooms and catering support areas. What is typically Swedish? Our answer is the red light that appears with the low setting sun at dusk. Sweden's northern latitude is radically different to Washington's geographical location. We wanted to create "the Nordic light in the dark Southern night". This was achieved by backlighting the panels cloaking the balconies around the building. The architects originally intended to use real wooden veneer on the balconies, enclosed between two sheets of glass. However, they decided instead to use computer-generated images which were printed straight onto the laminated film. Six different patterns of exaggerated wood grain were combined to form an elegant façade around the private apartments. The whole of the façade is illuminated from behind in the evenings and at night, making the building glow like a huge lamp. The computer-generated image we submitted with our original proposal is almost identical to the building today.

Sweden is also a kingdom of pure water. Mist that rises in the mornings with the dancing elves. Crisp snow covering the panes of glass. The black pond reflecting the pines. Warm breath misting the window. We work with a gradient of white dots on glass panels. On the exterior, the gradient extends over three storeys. Crystal-clear glass at the bottom that gradually becomes speckled with more and more dots until it is completely white when it reaches the blue sky. It is the opposite way round in the northern escape stairwell. Above the entrance hall's "spark gap" of openness, the building is suspended as though carved from blond, American maple. The technically compact façade, thirty centimetres behind the glass gradient, moves seamlessly from external to internal ceiling where the entire atrium is clad with wood veneer panels, finishing with the horizontal wooden surfaces of the rooftop terrace. It is the Swedish tradition to clad a building in wood (expertly executed in Gothenburg by Asplund in the town hall extension and by Nils Einar Ericksson in the concert hall). The stairs, walls and floors inside the embassy are also made of maple. The light reflects warmly from the wood and imparts a flattering warmth to everyone and everything. A cloud hovers above the entrance floor. The maple ceiling is cut through with unevenly spaced, round holes.

A pixelling effect whose compactness increases inwards. Lamps across the ceiling shed their light. The resulting effect is a shimmering, shifting cloud of light. The many holes are covered by white cloth and act naturally as an absorbent. The white stone Timpa floor incorporates black, shiny stripes of polished granite. The floor looks as though it has been rolled out like long mats, side by side, resembling traditional Swedish rag-rugs. We encounter the most sophisticated details in the sensitive zone, between the indoors and outdoors. Two, real water-filled walls stand like curtains along both short sides of the windbreak. On the right, a manmade pond of polished, black granite with narrow, frosted streaks complement the stone "rug floor" alongside. The building's most stunning glass installation faces the embassy, standing freely like a wall from floor to ceiling. The thick crystal glass has been pinched out using bone glue to create patterns that bring to mind the very fragile film of ice that covers a pool of water on an evening in early March. Visitors to the embassy offices have to walk through a security passage, which turns with a couple of sharp bends, round the reception area. When they leave the building, they have a moment's undisturbed view of the glass wall where they can see, in columns between the pinched-out glass, the real river flowing past just a short distance away. Two contrasts - the one frozen stiff and the other moving with life. "Magic", by the Swedish glass artist Ingegerd Råman.

Two, real water-filled walls stand like curtains along both short sides of the windbreak. On the right, a manmade pond of polished, black granite with narrow, frosted streaks complement the stone "rug floor" alongside. The building's most stunning glass installation faces the embassy, standing freely like a wall from floor to ceiling. The thick crystal glass has been pinched out using bone glue to create patterns that bring to mind the very fragile film of ice that covers a pool of water on an evening in early March. Visitors to the embassy offices have to walk through a security passage, which turns with a couple of sharp bends, round the reception area. When they leave the building, they have a moment's undisturbed view of the glass wall where they can see, in columns between the pinched-out glass, the real river flowing past just a short distance away. Two contrasts - the one frozen stiff and the other moving with life.

A representation of contemporary living, to be built almost entirely with tensed rope to enclose spaces that relate to how we live.More about Ghost House: More about Ghost House:GhostHouse is about domesticity. It expresses the tension in our minds between the bustling excitement of the contemporary spaces we live in, and our persistent yearning for a log cabin in the woods –a timeless, traditional house. GhostHouse is about domesticity. It expresses the tension in our minds between the bustling excitement of the contemporary spaces we live in, and our persistent yearning for a log cabin in the woods –a timeless, traditional house.The installation is divided into 3 parts. The main triangular courtyard accommodates three open rooms dedicated to the spirit of modern living. These large spaces offer fluid dining, sitting, and bathing experiences (the time-honored water feature of PS1 is reinvented as a cluster of second-hand bathtubs). In keeping with a contemporary aesthetic, there are no doors or windows to these rooms; visitors enter or exit though missing walls. The installation is divided into 3 parts.

In keeping with a contemporary aesthetic, there are no doors or windows to these rooms; visitors enter or exit though missing walls.The mid-sized rectangular courtyard accommodates the ethereal structure that gives the entire installation its name: the ghost house. In this courtyard we simply tried to create what most visitors would readily recognize as a house. Given our chosen technique of tensioning ropes back to the bolt holes of the surrounding concrete walls, our low-fidelity house offers only the minimum features of house-ness: a pitched roof, an eve, and a chimney. Finally, the third and smallest courtyard serves as a TV room. The mid-sized rectangular courtyard accommodates the ethereal structure that gives the entire installation its name: the ghost house.

We chose to work with 32mm blue, red, and white polypropylene. This light and flexible plastic polymer is commonly used in clothing and packaging, and is easily recycled. In 1995, Christo and Jeanne-Claude used the same cobalt-blue, 32mm-thick braid to tie the wrapping of the Reichstag. 97% of the proposal is made of rope.

Text description provided by the architects. Stockholm Waterfront lies adjacent to Stockholm’s Central Station. The site has the best public exposure in Stockholm, with thousands of train passengers passing by every day - its position on the Riddarfjärden bay and its proximity to Stockholm’s City Hall also make it an ideal location.

The project consists of three separate buildings with a lower congress and concert section closest to the water, an office building, and a 400-room hotel directly connected to the congress building. However, it was not possible to accommodate the requirement for a 3,000-seat congress hall and a 2,000-seat dining room, within the triangular plot.

White’s solution was the key to its success. The equation was solved with moveable seating dual-use spaces and a large section of the congress hall suspended beyond the confines of the site, like an enormous canopy over the entrance. Altering the Stockholm skyline also required the confidence of the client and the authorities.

The upper part of the congress hall will also be spectacular - a free form interacting with movement on the flyovers and quays around the building. The upper seating assemblies seat 1,500 people and allow rapid conversion into two separate halls. The lower section of the hall can add a similar number of visitors in cinema-style seating. Alternatively, the lower seating assemblies can quite simply be retracted to provide space for 2,000 banquet guests.

Text description provided by the architects. An installation in the newest location of Vancouver Circus School, the project was conceived as backdrop to the spectacular circus events. The use of standard dimensional lumber forms a playful take on the archetypal “circus tent” that houses the Circus’ office function. A long linear line of plywood makes up an array of seating and cubby storage, and a playground slide marks the entrance to the Circus School for kids only.

The interior architecture creates a place to work, a place to play and a place to watch the fanciful acrobatics. “Stick Forest” forms a guardrail behind the seating area, while evoking the landscape art installation beyond. A field of yellow juggling balls fills the walls of the circus office tent, mimicking the sense of play and wonder inherent in the School itself.

Text description provided by the architects. The School Centre is part of the extension of the school campus Lättenwiese, which was built in the 70ties. The extension foresees two buildings added on the edges of the campus connecting the old town of Opfikon with the emerging area Zurich North, and thus creating a new urban orientation of the school campus. The low, wide volume of the School Centre refers to the scale of the old town.

The building is a hybrid and combines educational, social and administrative agendas such as a day-kindergarten, therapy (e.g. speech therapy) and office spaces. It is therefore not a typical school building but rather represents the fact that non-educational services for pupils ( i.e. individual support, supervised lunch-time, health counseling etc.) has been integrated in the Swiss School System within the last few years. The wide corridors, with their parallel set open spaces, establish a solid element within the building and maintain a network of the school and its educational and administrative services under one roof. The conglomerate of different uses is bound together with a homogenized façade, covered with concrete panels in diverse shimmering greens and band windows. Glass and concrete are mounted in a grid, only where the inner public corridor touches the façade, huge framed windows are cut out.

Text description provided by the architects. The park-like site is dominated by a bulky, authoritative old school building from the early twentieth century that has had many extensions added. The most recent extension concentrates on a precisely set single building, which enhances the different areas of the park, without affecting its space continuum. The new building is four floors in height and provides, at an appropriate distance, a new, confident opponent towards the 19th Century main building. Physiotherapy rooms and the entrance area form the one storey porch. Behind, two classrooms, with in between set preparation and related adjoining rooms, repeats on four floors. Entrance, corridors and stairways are designed as open spaces and are kept rough - which contrasts with the precise and simple design and the realization of furniture and finishings.

The classrooms, however, are all built with robust and high-quality materials, for example: wall plasterwork with magnetite and lime, the floors in oiled oak industry parquet and curtains made from felt blankets.

The new building is clothed in raw aluminum which is folded around the building; only the main facades remain free. The metal is perforated and appears as a woven curtain. Like a chameleon it assimilates to its environment – disappears suddenly so as to reappear in the same place. Through the fine and precise workmanship the raw aluminium loses its renown as an ephemeral and ordinary material used only for temporary buildings.

The new building, perceived as a densification of the existing context, led to a focused use of available resources and a respectful approach of the urban green spaces, which have recently become rare. It is the result of concentrating all former provisional spaces of the center for hearing and language under one new, common roof.

Situated near the entrance to the Gowanus Canal, formerly the site of a police impound lot, the 11-acre pier will house a new 125,500 sqf facility for recycling and education. Designed by Selldorf Architects, the Sunset Park Materials Recycling Facility was not just conceived as a facility for recycling, but also as an active classroom. The approximate 2.5 acres of green space, complete with grazing goats, 50,000 sqf of photovoltaic cells and hopeful wind turbine, will offer an observation corridor and educational classrooms for students. The site is currently being raised four feet by construction crews and a completion date of December 2011 is anticipated.Situated near the entrance to the Gowanus Canal, formerly the site of a police impound lot, the 11-acre pier will house a new 125,500 sqf facility for recycling and education.

The program includes a visitors’ center and administration building, an enclosed barge unloading facility, and a materials-handling building for processing and storage of recyclable plastic, metal and glass. The visitors’ center and administration building includes an exhibition space, classrooms, cafeteria, offices and locker rooms, and is linked to observation areas in the recycling building via a pedestrian bridge.

The visitors’ center and administration building includes an exhibition space, classrooms, cafeteria, offices and locker rooms, and is linked to observation areas in the recycling building via a pedestrian bridge.Working within the constraints of a pre-engineered building, one of the design challenges was to find ways to articulate the program and give an overall expression to the facility that would distinguish it from the ordinary big box construction. The tipping building where materials arrive via barge or truck, has a fully exposed main frame structure made from galvanized steel to withstand the elements. The adjacent processing and bale storage buildings are clad in corrugated metal which also wraps around the tipping building at the upper level. All the buildings sit on a unifying concrete plinth. The design incorporates many sustainable initiatives including solar panels, stormwater collection, bioswales and a wind-turbine generating electrical power.Working within the constraints of a pre-engineered building, one of the design challenges was to find ways to articulate the program and give an overall expression to the facility that would distinguish it from the ordinary big box construction.

QuaDror, invented and patented by Dror Benshetrit, is a space truss geometry system inspired by versatility and structural integrity of interlocking members.Like a magician revealing the secrets behind his magic, Dror Benshetrit shows that the mechanism behind these structures is surprisingly simple but it is the complex interaction of the interlocking members that makes it so unique. From a simple block model to a bridge support system, the QuaDror system shows its abilities at all scales.Like a magician revealing the secrets behind his magic, Dror Benshetrit shows that the mechanism behind these structures is surprisingly simple but it is the complex interaction of the interlocking members that makes it so unique.

Embarking on a four year investigation centered around collaboration and experimentation, Dror Benshetrit’s team developed a system that produces overwhelming strength and great adaptability to configure for a variety of conditions. The versatility of QuaDror is an asset that makes it distinct, because of its ability to accommodate our ever-changing profession of design.Embarking on a four year investigation centered around collaboration and experimentation, Dror Benshetrit’s team developed a system that produces overwhelming strength and great adaptability to configure for a variety of conditions. The versatility of QuaDror is an asset that makes it distinct, because of its ability to accommodate our ever-changing profession of design.Letting the geometry of the structural system drive their investigations, five development directions for applications became apparent. The five applications appear almost limitless: dividing, dwelling, trestle, fenestration, and artistic installation.

Text description provided by the architects. The Alhambra house is located in an upper-middle class neighborhood composed of single-family residences arranged on a garden-city type urban lay-out .  The residence sits on a lot of 950 square meters, and is flanked by similarly sized parcels on both of its sides (east and west); the south side of the property is defined by the street, whereas the north side butts the metropolitan train system. The clients/residents were a young professional couple with two small children. They were both well-traveled and shared a common interest for modern design and architecture.  The given program simply called for a house  with "a central, open kitchen, a studio-office loft, open living spaces, and a general reorientation towards the patio".  The decision to re-use the existing structure was determined by 3 main factors: (a) budget constraints, (b) the desire to minimize the creation of off-site waste, and (c) restrictive zoning guidelines for new construction. The existing house contained a monumental Japanese oak in its patio, a fact that shaped the basic design strategy for the project, as we decided to enhance it by focusing the new living spaces around it.  By doing so, the tree not only became the visual centerpiece of the intervention, but was also made into the principal temperature-control device, as both light filter , and natural air conditioner .  The design also incorporates large glass doors and windows, as well as central skylights distributed throughout the house, bringing natural daylight in order to reduce electrical illumination during the day. The main living space is covered by a south facing sloping roof that was specifically prepared  to accommodate water-heating solar panels, and a photo-voltaic battery-charging system.  Because of budget constraints, these last two were postponed for future installation. The project also incorporates a swimming pool and an outdoor gazebo .  The gazebo echoes the opening-towards-the-tree gestures and the constructive elements of the main structure, while the pool, in addition of being a recreational water oasis, serves as connector between the main house and the gazebo.

"The Cube" is an open-air performance venue set against the backdrop of historic warehouses in Winnipeg’s Exchange District. The design commission gained through an invited competition, recognizes that the stage typically functions as such during a very limited time season, and questioned what opportunities the venue could provide during the rest of the year. In its final rendition the stage is articulated as a multi-functional environment that shifts from a vibrant performance space to an ephemeral, glowing,interactive pavilion and focal point."The Cube" is an open-air performance venue set against the backdrop of historic warehouses in Winnipeg’s Exchange District.

In its final rendition the stage is articulated as a multi-functional environment that shifts from a vibrant performance space to an ephemeral, glowing,interactive pavilion and focal point.The outer shell of the stage is a dynamic membrane composed of diamond extrusions strung together to form a flexible curtain that draws back to reveal stage and structure within. The retracted skin in turn becomes a draped and undulating ceiling landscape providing a backdrop for performance and allowing adjustments to the stage’s acoustics. When closed, the angled diamond pieces capture and refract light or images to their outer surface, creating a unique pixel matrix. Programmable lighting shines onto the pixelated skin offering a canvas for interactive displays - seasonally programmed and available for active engagements by local artists. The Stage in its closed position also accommodates small gatherings and exhibitions inside.

The challenge was to create a unique meshwork, that would be “soft” enough to drape open, and rigid enough to provide a solid barrier. Early prototypes were developed that examined chain-mail as a precedent - a flexible protective membrane that could form the venue’s envelope.

Early prototypes were developed that examined chain-mail as a precedent - a flexible protective membrane that could form the venue’s envelope.A second key goal was to explore the capacity for the membrane to capture images projected upon its surface. Technical constraints were imposed by the distance from the screen to the back wall of the stage (where the projector would be housed), and the fact that images would hit the back screen face, but would be observed when looking towards the stage. We examined the size and number of elements necessary to effectively capture the projected images. Research was done that determined which “short throw” projector would be required to expand the image within the short projection distance available to us. In addition we explored, through prototypes, the depth of the cells, their ability to flip the projection, maintain resolution, and image integrity.

In addition we explored, through prototypes, the depth of the cells, their ability to flip the projection, maintain resolution, and image integrity.Working with a local manufacturer we commissioned samples of various extrusions, initially made from flat aluminum pieces welded together. Once a suitable prototype was selected, the manufacturer ordered custom aluminum extrusions from which individual pieces could be cut. The scale of the project merited the purchase of a self feeding saw, which steam-lined manufacturing of the 18,000 metal pieces. In addition, a polishing drum rolled each piece to grind down and finish the edge surfaces.

In addition, a polishing drum rolled each piece to grind down and finish the edge surfaces.Individual extrusions were strung together through pre-cut holes using aircraft cable to hold cells in place. The orientation of each piece alternates up and down vertically along the line of the cable, with adjacent rows of cells being riveted together at every third piece. The membrane is thereby able to cascade gently, while maintaining continuous surface integrity. Pre-strung panels of screen were erected on site before being riveted together to form a continuous assembly.

Pre-strung panels of screen were erected on site before being riveted together to form a continuous assembly.In its final installation, the screen is able to hang vertically, sealing off the 28’ x 28’ cube. When lifted, the screen folds back in a gentle curve revealing the performance space below, and forming an acoustical backdrop. When closed, the polished aluminum extrusions form a light reflecting surface, that is able to interact with floor lights and projectors to create dynamic, programmable light displays.

Text description provided by the architects. This project is located on the 19th floor of a midtown 1959 modernist building. It includes the full renovation of 15,000sf for offices for a branding research and communication office. 711 Third Avenue, 19th Floor, Midtown, NYC / 15,000sf The objectives for this young research communication agency moving from Soho, NYC was to create an identity for their new midtown offices. We demolished existing perimeter offices, wood paneling, soffits and finishes and created an open, clean work plan with meeting and breakout areas, a viewing facility, conference room, and flexible event space.  The space needed to be conducive to idea sessions and also hosting clients and viewing facility users. The use of graphic custom-designed light fixtures at the low ceiling level creates a visual landscape in what would otherwise be a field of monotonous acoustic tile. Also custom graphic walls inspire and invigorate the space. The graphic design depicts the networking of the internet and speaks abstractly to the communication and interlinking of ideas, innovation, and global reach of the agency and its clients.

As the project had a tight budget, we experimented with custom designs that could be made locally by fabricators we work with frequently. We developed a colorful coat hook system along a back wall that is practical yet provides a graphic element when empty so is dual-purposed. A custom powder-coated mesh wall in the Event Space allows the staff to use magnets to hang posters, idea sessions and interoffice communication with ease. A favorite local nursery supplied 20 large tropical plants placed throughout the office—to add some nature to the high rise office space.

Text description provided by the architects. There are some buildings that do not belong to any time or age. The Saint Mary Cathedral of Tokyo by Kenzo Tange is definitely one of these. Of course materials and technologies make it recognizable as a project of the 20th century, but we could easily say that this project has been built yesterday the same as 50 years ago. It’s not usual, in terms of the quality of architecture. And it is not the only quality of this project.

The Tokyo Cathedral has been completed in 1964, replacing the old wooden cathedral, in gothic style, burnt during wartime. Tange conceived the new church as a concrete structure, simple in concept and complex in shape, which recalls the lightness of a bird and its wings.

The eight walls – the elements which hold the whole structure – are at the same time roof and walls, enclosing the space and opening to the outside through vertical gaps. The walls are curved hyperbolically to express the tension to the sky, and turning the rhomboidal ground floor into a cross at the roof top. The different heights of the wings, asymmetrical, make it a dynamic shape on the sky background. The highest wing is 39,41 m high.

The reflection of the sunlight on the stainless steel external cladding looks as a shining dress on the hard concrete slabs. Although it is a monochromatic cladding, the curves and the U-shaped profiles enhance the dynamicity of the structure. It all makes the church an iconic building in the dense urban context of Tokyo.

The fragmentation is challenged The block 39 is an entity: a perimeter with a disk. A fluid continuum that embraces and defends the integrity of the center. It is a world apart but still a part of the bigger whole, a transition line and an interior, in contrast but not opposed to the exterior. Infiltration is vital to the accomplishment of the center. The perimeter has no beginning and no end, it gives no preference, unifies and enables the flow of movement in,around and within.The disk is the soul defined by the body. The circle enabled by the new buildings that emerge is stimulated by the constant flow into, through and within. The center for the promotion of science – a circular segment – a piece cut of by a chord, the perimeter but already the disk, a presence that gives possibility, provokes movement, provokes thought. Formally, it is defined by the shape, to which it shall give its essence. A circle  interrupts the rigidity and uniformity of the square grid.

It is a world apart but still a part of the bigger whole, a transition line and an interior, in contrast but not opposed to the exterior. Infiltration is vital to the accomplishment of the center. The perimeter has no beginning and no end, it gives no preference, unifies and enables the flow of movement in,around and within.The disk is the soul defined by the body. The circle enabled by the new buildings that emerge is stimulated by the constant flow into, through and within. The center for the promotion of science – a circular segment – a piece cut of by a chord, the perimeter but already the disk, a presence that gives possibility, provokes movement, provokes thought. Formally, it is defined by the shape, to which it shall give its essence.“boundaries are actually the main factor in space, just as the present, another boundary, is the main factor in time.” – Eduardo Chillida “boundaries are actually the main factor in space, just as the present, another boundary, is the main factor in time.” – Eduardo ChillidaThe pergola – the perimeter – a integral part of the center for the promotion of science brings the entire block together and invites the outside inside,into the secret garden of science. The pergola by its size and various functions  is to bring the quarter to a human scale. While being a physical boundary the pergola retains a visual transparency  that links the block with the surroundings and becomes an integral part of the outside as well as the inside. The pergola enables a flow of movement between the various buildings that are to appear in the near future. The building lines in block 39 are compatible with those of its surroundings. The pergola unites all the different functions of block 39 and brings together the different generations that are to learn, work and play in this new environment.

You enter a crevice lit by an opening in the roof. A rectangular painting of the sky opens up above you and then you continue on your path, either into the building or ahead, into the  garden. The spatial relationships inside the building are defined by the fissure as well. It divides it into two parts that converge on the first floor where one may look down through a glass opening onto the passerbys or, once again, up onto the rectangular framing of the sky.  The functions of the building are divided into two sections, on two sides of the fissure and the movement of visitors is established around the hollow belly of the building.

Text description provided by the architects. Andrew Cohen Architects conceived Page Road House's iconic sculptural form in dialogue with the landscape and topography of a densely wooded 12-acre site in Lincoln, a close suburb of Boston that has carefully preserved its agrarian character. After commissioning ACA to design the Springstep Center for the Arts, the homeowner sought an equally ambitious and forward-looking design for her home to convey her passion for the performing and visual arts. As the founding director of Springstep, she entertains and hosts fundraising events frequently, so the house needed spaces commodious enough to contain a crowd, while still being an inviting and intimate retreat the rest of the time.

The architects’ strategy was to compose the plan first and then wrap it in a tight skin, so the building’s function is the source of its exuberant form. Spaces are arranged along the interior according to frequency of use and various levels of privacy to break down the 6995-sf space into discrete interlocking volumes.  The kitchen and primary living spaces occupy the ground level, with direct access to the terraces and the adjacent landscape. In the living room, floor-to-ceiling windows are set at grade to create a seamless and porous relationship with the landscape. The master bedroom suite is accessed via two separate sets of stairs, neither of which is directly connected to the public spaces to preserve privacy during events. The rest of the house’s program areas are located across a wide landing at the main entry, which offers another layer of privacy from visitors.  Placing all of the spaces the residents use most frequently—the kitchen and main living spaces, master bedroom and offices—in easy reach effectively reduces the house’s apparent scale.  Strategic cuts in the building skin allow for diagonal views through the house and out to the landscape beyond, thereby drawing relationships between seemingly isolated spaces so multiple areas can be appreciated simultaneously.

Although the house is sizeable, the architects incorporated several sustainable strategies to reduce the its impact on the environment.  A ground source geothermal system supports the house’s heating and cooling requirements.  Double-wall assembly with 6” of Icynene insulation combined with a highly reflective CPO roof membrane creates an efficient building envelope.  All of the rainwater that falls on the house is returned to the aquifer via a recharge system.  Although photovoltaics and solar heat panels were explored, it was determined that the site was too shaded for the system to function optimally.

Text description provided by the architects. On this very little plot it was impossible to challenge the two high level neighbours which have respectively 6 en 9 floors because a nursery can hardly have more than 2 floors. And feeting to the neigbours would have underlined the disproportion of the statures.

Architectures came up with an other idea : despite the narrowness of the plot, the buiding does not press itself against its neighbours. Then it becomes autonomious and it curls up on intself lihe a snail in it shell. indeed it fits to its little users.

The building is located atop an ocean bluff, with strong winds, western sun, an existing grove of palms, and the ever-changing ocean providing the natural context. Responding to these forces without impacting the site’s natural beauty was a driving goal in the design of the project. In addition, the uniquely informal character of the Scripps community, with its clear appreciation of the natural environment and outdoors, became an influential factor in the design. It was important to create a building that feels warm and inviting; and, more importantly, one that does not feel ‘institutional’. The goal was to create a state-of-the-art conference center where scientists dressed in shorts and flip-flops could feel at home. The auditorium was conceived of as a box within a box that can shed its layers depending on the event and the desired configuration. It can be completely enclosed for formal presentations and movies, or it can be opened to the oceanfront terrace with a series of pocketing doors that allow for indoor/outdoor receptions and banquets. In addition, each meeting room opens onto its own trellised terrace, enabling meetings and receptions to spill out onto the ocean bluff. To the east of the meeting rooms, there is an outdoor pre-function courtyard and garden protected from the ocean breezes for winter gatherings. West of the auditorium is a large outdoor terrace that overlooks the ocean. The auditorium is tucked into the hillside, minimizing its mass from the campus to the east, and allowing for gentle ramps to access a rooftop restaurant and terrace. The program is broken into several buildings connected by a trellised walkway, creating a porous structure that preserves ocean views and breezes for the rest of the campus. Exterior circulation takes advantage of San Diego’s temperate climate and greatly reduces the need for mechanical systems and artificial lighting.The design phase for this entirely gift-funded project spanned a long period of time and was completed prior to the establishment of the University’s LEED-certification goals. Despite this, instinctive design decisions regarding building envelope, materials, energy use, daylighting and passive cooling enabled the project to achieve LEED certification after the completion of construction.

This is RM&P’s third building within the Master Plan of Prague 4- Pankrác that began almost a decade ago with a local Czech developer and named the CITY Project. Based on RM&P’s Master Plan of the superblock on the Pankrác Plains, this once neglected area of Prague has now been transformed into a multi-functional, vibrant and revitalized business, commercial, and residential district filled with green public spaces and amenities.

Pujmanové and Hvĕzdova Streets with a cluster of three buildings. Conceived as a geometric volume in dialogue with the near context, City Green Court also offers respected contrast to the surrounding buildings. Like its earlier siblings City Tower and City Point, it is inspired by the language of Czech Cubism with an expressive façade that responds to issues of conservation and sustainability articulated with forms reminiscent of this avant-garde movement. When completed in early 2012, it will be a welcomed and key addition to the Pankrác superblock.

In contrast, the north and east facades do not need solar protection: shading is unnecessary to the north, and City Tower, the adjacent high rise standing on the neighboring site shields the building to the east. White spandrel glass replaces the fin panels producing facades which are calm, sleek and uniform. The four facades when juxtaposed create a harmonious and dynamic envelope that can be perceived differently from close and distant vantage points. The eight-story building is organized around a central sky-lit atrium surrounded by highly efficient office floor spaces. To the south, a grand canopy marks the formal entrance to the building that leads into a single height lobby which then opens into the multi-story atrium. Atop the seven office floor plates, the partial mechanical penthouse level is covered with an extensive green roof and a skylight. Nestled in the atrium is a singular black olive tree and green ivy wall, with bridges spanning above from one side of the space to the other while a free standing stair connects the first four floors promoting movement and interaction, and encouraging less use of elevators. The exterior and interior of City Green Court are intertwined visually and physically with landscape elements spilling into and reappearing in the atrium.

We hope that we continue to educate each other and influence future development with a critical outlook on architecture and social responsibility.”“Skanska Property Czech Republic, our Associate Architect CUBOID and our local consultants in Prague are fast becoming experts in green building design,” said Partner in Charge Dukho Yeon. “With its tautly composed form and elements, City Green Court embodies a certain discipline and restraint; designed within the framework of Skanska’s green initiative. We hope that we continue to educate each other and influence future development with a critical outlook on architecture and social responsibility.”City Green Court is expected to achieve LEED platinum certification in the Czech Republic by drastically reducing energy consumption. In addition to the very efficient building envelop, some of the most important measures towards LEED certification include natural ventilation of the atrium during the summer, state-of-the-art mechanical systems, reduction of water runoffs and storm water collection, green roof, indoor air quality control and the use of local and recycled materials. “We are proud to cooperate with Richard Meier & Partners Architects on the redesign of City Green Court to meet the growing interest in green, modern and flexible office space that offers a stimulating work environment,” said Britta Cesar, Managing Director of Skanska Property Czech Republic, and continued: ”Together with the enthusiasm and commitment from Richard Meier & Partners Architects we managed to achieve LEED platinum Pre-certification.”City Green Court is expected to achieve LEED platinum certification in the Czech Republic by drastically reducing energy consumption.

Text description provided by the architects. The pharmaceutical industry associates white as the symbol of cleanness and purity which is reflected in many aspects of western practice, including the adoption of the white wrapping paper in modern medicine. This is precisely the image the client of Impax from the United States aimed to establish through their first overseas facilities in Taiwan. The 12m high jointless exterior wall encloses the main functions of laboratory and office, creating an image of precision wrapping through its folded slabs. Two separated functions, the laboratory and office, are all contained within the wraps.

Through the floor-to-ceiling window walls, the programs are distinctively visible Duality, Impax’s core concept in medicine production, is interpreted though juxtaposing solid massing with void volume.  On the other hand, one of the client’s advanced patents involving stacking of micro-medicine films is represented by the hierarchical layering of programmatic spaces. On another level, the building’s vocabulary of architectural metaphors can be read as a time-released tablet emphasizing quality of spaces through years. To highlight the gradual-release concept, the design utilizes Impax’s corporate-identity blue colored stripe windows in random sizes, creating a vibrant pattern on the façade and set the tone for future expansion. The curving wood strip wall in the main lobby also carries the “wrapping” theme by continuing the texture throughout the interior. The wood grains offer a warm touch to soften the sleek and modern pharmaceutical character.
Text description provided by the architects. The pharmaceutical industry associates white as the symbol of cleanness and purity which is reflected in many aspects of western practice, including the adoption of the white wrapping paper in modern medicine. This is precisely the image the client of Impax from the United States aimed to establish through their first overseas facilities in Taiwan. Text description provided by the architects.

New architecture firm names are getting out of hand. It’s as if they are trying to sound like Indie bands. Barring that, they often fall back on “Atelier such and such.” One trendy use of atelier has been the “Atelier insert-your-name-here” variation. This has been way overdone. There is also the “Atelier theoretical buzz word” version. New architecture firm names are getting out of hand. It’s as if they are trying to sound like Indie bands.

It’s not the language’s fault. It’s the context. Not only does it sound pretentious, but it is pretentious, literally, because it is a term recently taken up by smaller architecture firms to signify cultural and aesthetic achievements that in many cases have not yet occurred. It thus represents aspirations. The problem with atelier in an English-dominated context is that it sounds pretentious. French words often do. It’s not the language’s fault. It’s the context.

It derives from the Old French word, astelier, referring to a carpenter’s workshop or the wood shavings left on the floor. It originally connoted craftsmanship and the making of things of a more everyday sort. In time it acquired meanings associated with artists’ studios—primarily those of struggling artists. It was simply that place where they worked, nothing fancier than that. It was used the same way studio is used in English. I’m going to the studio. It means one thing to say I’m going to the studio in English and something completely different to say, in English again, I’m going to the atelier. First, if you ever said this you would sound like an asshole. Moreover, the origins of the word are much more modest and folksy.

Text description provided by the architects. The task was to Develope stable amenities for Frisona horses, including cleaning, saddle, sickbay rooms and offices. In order to allow an easy growth of the horses farm, the design was based in a repeatable  module frame which allows to hold structure for the walls and roofs of the stable.

The Project was designed taking into consideration the weather conditions of the site (3000 mm average rainfall) and the necessity of generating a protected space, but which at the same time allows appropriate ventilation. The Project considers a big Metallic roof supported by the wooden frames and covered in three faces for rain isolation.

It is possible to define the Project as a big twisted Square frame under which a programatic extruded cube is allocated. One module is devoted to the estables, the other to the offices and in the space created between both it is the saddle room. The position of both modules consider the landscape of the site and the old trees in the surroundings.

The core of its architecture is the way the concert, theater and multi-purpose halls are coordinated with the service areas. The halls are arranged in a row according to their functions, and the organization of the service areas allows common production equipment to serve all halls efficiently and without interference. The service areas are located on one side of the halls and the foyer on the other. The varying forms of the auditoria will be covered by a curved wooden wall. The monumental abstract form of the wall, made of local oak, separates reality from fantasy. Kilden produces experiences.

Text description provided by the architects. Our first religious commission was a wedding chapel conceived to celebrate the first day of a couple’s new life. Our second religious commission had a diametrically opposite purpose: to mourn the passing of loved ones. This premise was the main driving force behind the design, the two had to be complete opposites, they were natural antagonists. While the former praised life, the latter grieved death. Through this game of contrasts all the decisions were made: Glass vs. Concrete, Transparency vs. Solidity, Ethereal vs. Heavy, Classical Proportions vs. Apparent Chaos, Vulnerable vs. Indestructible, Ephemeral vs. Lasting…

The client brief was pretty simple, almost naïve: First, the chapel had to take full advantage of the spectacular views. Second, the sun had to set exactly behind the altar cross (of course, this is only possible twice a year at the equinoxes). And last but not least, a section with the first phase of crypts had to be included outside and around the chapel. Metaphorically speaking, the mausoleum would be in perfect utopian synchrony with a celestial cycle of continuous renovation.

Two elements obstructed the principal views: large trees and abundant vegetation, and a behemoth of a boulder blocking the main sight of the sunset. In order to clear these obstructions (blowing up the gigantic rock was absolutely out of the question for ethical, spiritual, environmental and, yes, economical reasons) the level of the chapel had to be raised at least five meters. Since only exotic and picturesque vegetation surrounds this virgin oasis, we strived to make the least possible impact on the site reducing the footprint of the building to nearly half the floor area of the upper level.

Acapulco’s hills are made up of huge granite rocks piled on top of each other. In a purely mimetic endeavor, we worked hard to make the chapel look like “just another” colossal boulder atop the mountain.

Liberty Architecture (Lib.A) shared with us their competition entry for a pilgrimage center in La Vang, Vietnam, which is a small area located in the central province of Quang Tri. The client wanted to develop the area within two decades and asked for a layout that would allow an easy development taking place in the future. Lib.A’s main concept is to re-create the original woods where the Holy Mary appeared. The Cathedral is also conceived as an artificial wood. This original concept of the wood aims to create an uninterrupted and undirected space that allows people to draw their own paths within the Only Path of the Faith. More images and architects’ description after the break.Liberty Architecture (Lib.A) shared with us their competition entry for a pilgrimage center in La Vang, Vietnam, which is a small area located in the central province of Quang Tri.

Besides, since the whole province was the buffer zone where Vietnam was split into two parts during the Vietnam War, it was the most damaged place to suffer from the fierce front.

Besides, since the whole province was the buffer zone where Vietnam was split into two parts during the Vietnam War, it was the most damaged place to suffer from the fierce front.The Story: There was a story about the apparitions of Mother Mary at this place 200 years ago to save Vietnamese Christians when they were chased and executed by the governor. Eventually, the place was acclaimed to be the Holy Land and its church was raised to be one of the five Cathedral Basilicas of Vietnam in 1961 before it was damaged by the war.

Also, the traditional spaces of Catholicism worship are tendentiously separate from the outside to maintain a solemn environment for the rites.

Also, the traditional spaces of Catholicism worship are tendentiously separate from the outside to maintain a solemn environment for the rites.On the contrary, the large pilgrimages always contain the atmosphere of the crowds which are continuously changing and easily render into negation. The consequent results are the chaotic atmosphere and spaces for daily needs of the pilgrims. However, the crowds are always open, welcome and absorbent. Two action programs, two contrary characteristic spaces need to be unified and absorb each other.

The consequent results are the chaotic atmosphere and spaces for daily needs of the pilgrims. However, the crowds are always open, welcome and absorbent. Two action programs, two contrary characteristic spaces need to be unified and absorb each other.Solution: In line with the main concept, the cathedral is an open structure that helps render the solemn atmosphere inside to outside and render people from outside to inside. At this point, the elements of traditional architecture, roofs, columns and verandas can make it possible. No traditional image, ornament or technique is kept in this design except these three fundamental elements which maintain not only the basic need of cover and protection but also provide a soft cover allowing absorbance between inside and outside. This kind of traditional structure keeps everything both open and close, improves the micro-climate inside and helps save energy.

This spatial memorial does not introduce the pilgrims any pre-organized path but leaves them undirected. Thus this experience of getting through a wood mentally and physically reminds the pilgrims their ancestor who lived and died bravely to protect their Faith. Yet the vision of the Tower of Light (the bell-tower) which represents Jesus Christ gives them the only visual direction to follow.

“The Bridge” Homeless Assistance Center in downtown Dallas is no longer considered just the standard bearer for homeless center design in the United States, but it is now the world’s model for homeless center design, since winning the “Best Architectural Entry” award in the International Rebranding Homelessness Competition, hosted by South Africa’s Tshwane Leadership Foundation. The competition honors homeless facilities and initiatives around the world that seek to develop a new language, new visions and new approaches to addressing homelessness, challenge perpetuating myths and perceptions, and demonstrate viable alternatives, both to homelessness and to the way in which homelessness is dealt.“The Bridge” Homeless Assistance Center in downtown Dallas is no longer considered just the standard bearer for homeless center design in the United States, but it is now the world’s model for homeless center design, since winning the “Best Architectural Entry” award in the International Rebranding Homelessness Competition, hosted by South Africa’s Tshwane Leadership Foundation.

Text description provided by the architects. A suite of small interlinked courtyards creates a complex playing space. As in entering a walled enclosure, the building looks permeable from the interior and opaque from its urban context. 
Save this picture!
The idea of creating an introverted perimeter construction capable of housing a complex interior space has much to do with a protective attitude but is also reinforced by the small dimensions of the plot, leading the heart of the star shaped courtyard to accommodate the sports zone and to partially make the most of the permitted (ground floor + 2), while creating a series of concatenated open spaces at different heights to counteract the limitations of the plot. The result is that, when crossing the perimeter shell, the pupils find themselves in a surprising central space where a set of acronyms at different heights help to understand the interior of the school as a single multiform yard extending over the different floors, configuring a great collection of relationship spaces at different heights. A three-dimensional organization chart built from reinforced concrete, where each classroom or workshop occupies a differentiated volume, allows the acronyms to be seen from the entire yard. A single material builds the structure and the enclosure, permitting a considerable increase in façade surfaces while minimizing construction and maintenance costs.

The ground floor houses the specific labs and workshops shared by Secondary and Sixth Form: library, chemistry and physics and natural sciences labs, plastic arts and technology workshops, multiuse hall, students’ hall and cafeteria. These are halls with larger surfaces for specific activities that may occasionally be carried out in the open air in their respective associated yards and that can operate independently from the regulated school rhythm.

The first floor groups the 12 secondary school classrooms with their specific IT and music rooms. The circulations alternate outdoor and indoor routes to give access to the different classrooms. This circulation space finishes in an extension of the central courtyard via a great pink hillock and a grandstand, halfway between the great central courtyard and the indoor pavilion. 
Save this picture!
The second floor houses the 4 Sixth Form classrooms with their respective specific rooms. Once again there is a sequence of indoor and outdoor circulations in order to emphasize the relations with the central courtyard, reinforcing the idea of a great courtyard extended in height.

The two protagonists of this grading of relationship spaces on this second floor are the aerial kitchen garden (recalling the farmland that surrounded Rafal, since this new perspective maintains a visual continuity with the nearby fields), and a small pink hill that owing to its strategic situation has become a popular meeting point.

The basic layout of the house is centered around the core living room space, referred to as The Great Hall on the floorplans, with four wings extended forming zones for the family. These include the master's bedroom, children's rooms, kitchen and servants quarters and the guestrooms and garage.

Totaling fourteen thousand square feet of floor space, the house was monumental in it's time.

Flooring is constructed out of four foot concrete squares, which help moderate the temperature of the house through their use of radiant heating. The slight glossiness is achieved using none other than the homeowner's Johnson Wax which was specifically designed after the construction of this house and and the corporate headquarters.

To add a playful touch to the elegant and beautiful interior of Wingspread, Frank Lloyd Wright introduced a spiral staircase for the children that led up to a lookout (or belvedere) on the roof.

Upon completion of three-quarters of the house, Mrs. Johnson passed away which led to an increasing disinterest in the construction of the house for Mr. Johnson. Wright once said that upon experiencing life within the house that she had desired so much, Mr. Johnson was able to be rejuvinated and find himself again.

Text description provided by the architects. Located in downtown Phoenix, the new six-story, 225,000 sqf, 110-foot tall, LEED Silver building has become an integral part of the fabric of ASU’s energizing downtown campus and a harbinger of Phoenix’s redevelopment. Delivered in a design-build, fast-track method, work began on design in October 2006 and the school opened its doors in August 2008, 22 months later. School schedules and budgets were both met.

Ground floor retail spaces and ample shaded arcades foster outdoor seating and café life. The main entrance to the structure is under a three-story high “front porch” facing the civic space, and includes a large, scrolling, electronic news ticker highlighting the most current headlines. Immediately adjacent to one of the stops on the newly completed Phoenix Light Rail and numerous bus stops, the Cronkite School allows students, teachers and professionals to arrive by public transportation. Parking capacity on the campus has been deliberately limited to encourage this. The building’s main entry fronts onto ‘Taylor Mall’ – an urban green belt that runs the full length of the downtown campus. This fosters community connectivity that places student housing, the new downtown Phoenix Civic Space, Student Union and Arizona Center Mall all within easy walking distance. In addition, many of the School of Journalism’s functions on upper levels, including the Cronkite News Service, are oriented toward and have open terraces overlooking Central Avenue, allowing the students and faculty to consistently be part of the bustle of downtown.

As truth and honesty are guiding principles to journalism – so are they to the design of the building. The architecture is specifically expressive of function and materiality. The design is based on an economical 30-foot square exposed structural concrete column grid with post-tensioned concrete floor slabs. The exterior is clad with glass, masonry and multi-colored metal panels - the pattern of the panels is inspired by U.S. broadcast frequency spectrum allocations (the Radio Spectrum). The composition is kinetic and dynamic – symbolic of journalism and media’s role in our society. The building’s massing incorporates appropriate sun screens on each of the four facades; their specific architectural treatment reduces the heat loads and is one of many of the LEED Silver building’s sustainable strategies. Burnished concrete block walls, ground and polished concrete floors and warm wood ceilings further express the forthright and direct nature of news delivery.

The Cronkite School occupies all of the second and third floors and a portion of the fourth and sixth floors. The airy, multi-tiered First Amendment Forum is the heart of the school. By day, students gather spontaneously between classes, and in the evenings, the grand hall transforms into a public forum where students and industry leaders discuss the most critical issues facing today’s news media. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is a theme repeated throughout the building. Floor-to-ceiling versions of the Amendment are found in the lobbies of each floor, and quotes about the importance of the Amendment to journalism encircle and embrace the central forum.

Half of the sixth floor has been custom tailored for the Cronkite News Watch. Both the newsroom and broadcast anchor desks are contained within one massive production space with views overlooking the city and beyond. Flanked by state-of-the-art control rooms and edit bays, Cronkite News Watch is in constant communication with itself and the community it serves. KAET Channel 8 Public TV also transmits live from their state-of-the-art studios on the sixth floor. This top floor location allows for long spans and high ceilings, required for the studios, and is constructed of a prefabricated lightweight steel structure. Satellite dishes from transmission are housed on the roof; they are specifically not screened and directly express the building’s function as one of communication.

Located in downtown Phoenix, the new six-story, 225,000 sqf, 110-foot tall, LEED Silver building has become an integral part of the fabric of ASU’s energizing downtown campus and a harbinger of Phoenix’s redevelopment. Delivered in a design-build, fast-track method, work began on design in October 2006 and the school opened its doors in August 2008, 22 months later. School schedules and budgets were both met.Text description provided by the architects.

The main entrance to the structure is under a three-story high “front porch” facing the civic space, and includes a large, scrolling, electronic news ticker highlighting the most current headlines. Immediately adjacent to one of the stops on the newly completed Phoenix Light Rail and numerous bus stops, the Cronkite School allows students, teachers and professionals to arrive by public transportation. Parking capacity on the campus has been deliberately limited to encourage this. The building’s main entry fronts onto ‘Taylor Mall’ – an urban green belt that runs the full length of the downtown campus. This fosters community connectivity that places student housing, the new downtown Phoenix Civic Space, Student Union and Arizona Center Mall all within easy walking distance. In addition, many of the School of Journalism’s functions on upper levels, including the Cronkite News Service, are oriented toward and have open terraces overlooking Central Avenue, allowing the students and faculty to consistently be part of the bustle of downtown.Ground floor retail spaces and ample shaded arcades foster outdoor seating and café life.

The architecture is specifically expressive of function and materiality. The design is based on an economical 30-foot square exposed structural concrete column grid with post-tensioned concrete floor slabs. The exterior is clad with glass, masonry and multi-colored metal panels - the pattern of the panels is inspired by U.S. broadcast frequency spectrum allocations (the Radio Spectrum). The composition is kinetic and dynamic – symbolic of journalism and media’s role in our society. The building’s massing incorporates appropriate sun screens on each of the four facades; their specific architectural treatment reduces the heat loads and is one of many of the LEED Silver building’s sustainable strategies. Burnished concrete block walls, ground and polished concrete floors and warm wood ceilings further express the forthright and direct nature of news delivery.As truth and honesty are guiding principles to journalism – so are they to the design of the building.

The airy, multi-tiered First Amendment Forum is the heart of the school. By day, students gather spontaneously between classes, and in the evenings, the grand hall transforms into a public forum where students and industry leaders discuss the most critical issues facing today’s news media. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is a theme repeated throughout the building. Floor-to-ceiling versions of the Amendment are found in the lobbies of each floor, and quotes about the importance of the Amendment to journalism encircle and embrace the central forum.The Cronkite School occupies all of the second and third floors and a portion of the fourth and sixth floors.

The access to the main entrance of the house it's done through a "negative in the centre of the body" (a patio that contains a small tree). Besides this opening in the roof, it has other four; we explore ways of air circulation, shades, contemplation; we want to enable different atmospheres.

Text description provided by the architects. This distinctive loft is located on the first floor of a historic warehouse on the Brouwersgracht in the centre of Amsterdam. The apartment is designed by Remco Wilcke of CUBE architecten and his partner Marloes van Heteren of SOLUZ. When they found the monument it was still in use as a warehouse, as two separate long and dark rooms of 100m2 each. They bought the place and hoped the council would let them change the status to 'dwelling', which they did after all the plans were submitted.

So in 2008 the old warehouse has been completely transformed to a 200m2 luxury loft. The wall between the two rooms has been opened up, and in the architecture a contrast has been sought between preserving the historic beams and floors, and minimalistic new additions. The new additions such as kitchen and bathroom would be clearly identifiable as such in terms of materiality and form.Because it is a deep and relatively low space, and letting daylight in is therefore very important, an open floor plan is chosen.

The open floor plan also fits the idea of the autonomous designed additions to the ancient monument. The bathroom is the central element in the house situated at the intersection of public and private. The rounded translucent bathroom-wall consists of nearly 1,000 very special glass blocks and acts as a subtle light-object at night next to the dining table. They actually are IKEA vases that are painted white from the inside, and glued together with transparent glue.

Text description provided by the architects. The Leavitt Residence is an extensive renovation of a 1920's mercantile building in the Chicago neighborhood of Bucktown. The 3-story existing structure consisted of heavy timber framing, with brick cladding at the exterior. An effort was made to respect the existing building while at the same time inserting dramatic new design gestures. The most significant insertion was to add an expansive window wall which extrudes upward and flows over the roof to create a highly transparent penthouse. The window wall provides connection to a private yard, a valuable asset in this dense urban setting.

The proposal is based on a series of arches constructed by filling geo textile tubes with gravel and sand at the botton, and recycled foam piles at the top. The heavy elements at the bottom secure the arches, while providing thermal mass to cool down the yard. FormlessFinder’s approach is very different from past installations, on which “temporary” is translated into lightweight elements. We present you “Bag Pile” by NY-based firm FormlessFinder.

This is because they are temporary, and until now temporary architecture has been equated with lightweight construction. But lightweight structures often miss opportunities – they are limited primarily to canopy types, lacking a meaningful connection to the ground or a real sense of interiority and enclosure. Worst of all, canopies provide only one type of space: an undifferentiated field. Being under one part of a canopy is rarely significantly different from being under any other part. formlessfinder instead seeks to provide a much richer – and more architectural – variety of experience through an intervention that is both temporary and massive.

Nothing is wasted when material is understood as part of a continuous cycle rather than as a raw resource to be fixed into architectural form. Bag Pile uses a palette of geotextile containers, products developed to control erosion and shifting material at a vast scale, in combination with heavy (gravel, sand) and light (recycled foam) fills to pack the PS1 courtyard with a tangle of columns, arches, and vaults. These elements are formed by combining heavy and light according to a simple structural principle – lightweight fill is used in overhead spans and tall vertical elements, which are always anchored to the ground and secured against wind loads through a ballast of heavy fill. Shipping and material costs are kept to a minimum not only by using industrial materials typically deployed at a much larger scale than that of the courtyard, but by sourcing materials locally – the heaviest material comes from less than a mile and a half from the site.	Demolition costs are more or less eliminated by finding destinations in advance for all materials to be recycled and repurposed. In this way, secondary materials – typically hidden from view in infrastructure and landscape projects – become primary. This combination becomes possible only when matter is left unfixed.

The first is a significant thermal mass cooling effect. The gravel-filled columns and footings cool down each night, following diurnal temperature swings. Their large mass, combined with carefully arranged self-shading, causes them to heat slowly during the day, keeping the interior spaces of Bag Pile significantly cooler than ambient daytime temperatures. The mass also provides an acoustic benefit. In contrast to a lightweight structure, which typically allows sound to travel through unaffected, Bag Pile’s large elements have been carefully arranged to maximize reflection, absorption, and dispersal of sound, creating varied pockets of sound and an array of listening experiences. These inherent acoustic properties are augmented by an acoustic installation incorporated into the structure. At key moments, Bag Pile’s elements are miked and amplified, creating a kind of soundtrack that highlights the fluid, formless nature of the project: foam creaks as it shifts in the wind, gravel settles into or spills out of its geotextile containers, water drips at the pool’s ragged edge. The acoustic installation also underscores the project’s tactile dimensions. It has been designed to engage visitors’ bodies as much as their eyes, and many of the miked elements are moments that particularly encourage bodily interaction, from movable furniture to sponge bag water features to tangles of foam-filled columns so dense that visitors must force their way through.

Bag pile provides an opportunity for visitors to lose the courtyard and immerse themselves in a new world, exploring spaces that range from large collective interiors designed specifically for the Warm Up events to small, intimate spaces perfect for individual occupation on a summer day. And because these spaces are crated with lose materials, the project remains dynamic, never fixed into a final form. Bag Pile thus offers not only a depth and variety of experience not yet seen in the PS1 YAP but a radically new understanding of the relationship between architectural space, material, and form.

Text description provided by the architects. This new 40,000 sqf state-of-the-art facility, located along Seattle’s light rail line, anchors Seattle Housing Authority’s (SHA) Rainier Vista housing redevelopment and has become a vital neighborhood community center. In collaboration with SHA the site plan was designed to maximize the neighborhood pedestrian connections and public amenities, including lighted paths, a new public play area and play field, and pedestrian plazas.

While cost-effective and durable, the design endeavors to “make the most with the least,” transcending industrial construction systems into an engaging, light-filled facility for children and teens. In an effort to resonate with kids, a straightforward expression of materials and methods of construction was embraced. The program includes game rooms, an Internet café, technology labs, a music studio, classrooms, and a double gymnasium and multipurpose room that can be opened up to create larger, shared spaces for community functions. Daylight is an essential material of the project, and the design creates dynamic opportunities for interaction and supervision between uses through inventive transparencies. A 2010 AIA Seattle Commendation Award winning project, it also incorporates numerous sustainable practices within the design earning a LEED Silver certification.

Text description provided by the architects. KPF transformed an existing surface parking lot into a mixed use development within Greenwich Village of Manhattan that received an AIA Honor Award. Considering the neighborhood fabric the design for One Jackson Square literally reflects its surroundings through its glazed facade and incorporates sustainable practices including green roofs and rainwater harvesting.  This project has received numerous awards for its integrated design including: SARA/NY Urban Contextual Award (2010), NY Construction Award of Merit (2010); Chicago Athenaeum/Europe American Architecture Award (2010); AIA NY State Award of Merit (2010), and the MIPIM AR Future Project Awards Commendation (2007). Located in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village, One Jackson Square is a 35-unit luxury residential development that responds in dramatic fashion to its celebrated locale. This historic district is home to the highest concentration of early architecture in New York City, and introducing new structures to this intricate fabric must respect its existing architecture, the artistic life within its boundaries, and the history that permeates its streets. The district, however, is not frozen in time, as its recent transformation into an affluent enclave has demonstrated.

Formerly a surface parking lot, the six-sided, split-zone site above two subway tunnels poses significant challenges, which the design negotiates through its massing, material expression, and robust foundation. It also provides a long-missing north edge to Jackson Square Park, a wedge-shaped space formed by the convergence of Greenwich and Eighth Avenues.

The building volume steps down from 11 stories to seven stories, from north to south, accommodating the zoning laws and mediating the varied scales of the neighborhood. Undulating bands of glass identify individual floors, creating a ribbon-like series of convexities and concavities along the street wall. The predominantly masonry structures of the immediate surroundings, along with the park, are “played back” in the glazed façade, creating an intimacy of scale congruent with the local context through juxtaposition. The fluid form of the façade is reprised in the lobby, where a bamboo-clad volume is conceived as a block of wood eroded over time by the ebb and flow of residents, much like a river erodes its banks.

A series of green roofs extends the private realm of the building into the public domain of the park. The planted decks also signal the project’s environmental agenda, which includes sustainable materials, rainwater harvesting, and daylighting. Born from the idiosyncrasies, scale, and spirit of the neighborhood, One Jackson Square sets a new standard for exceptional additions to the district’s historic fabric.

Text description provided by the architects. The Dutchess County Residence - Guest House is nestled within a mature deciduous forest of oak, hickory, and birch as a part of a larger site plan including a private residence and gallery. Situated above a bend in Ryder Creek it represents a place of silence, rest and reflection. Designed by Allied Works Architecture the home has received recognition from the American Institute of Architects, New York Chapter, receiving a 2009 Honor Award.

Allied Works Architecture was selected to site and design a private residence, with a guesthouse, an “art barn” for a private art collection, and various outbuildings on 450 acres of meadow and forest, approximately 100 miles north of New York City.

In summer, the house is animated by birdsong and immersed in dappled light. In winter, the house sits exposed in field of black tree trunks against a floor of white snow.

The structure of the house, a continuous line of eight-inch steel, moves through the site gathering in the forest. Constructed as a series of interlocking cantilevers, the structure edits and measures the forest, preparing the landscape for dwelling. Rooms are formed by panels of glass and wood that slip between, over, and through the frame as it meanders among the trees. The house provides a tenuous sense of boundary—held for a moment under the forest canopy, framing the changing light and seasons.

This house on a Maine woodlot is designed as a weave of volumes and courtyards that strikes a precise balance between solid and void. Neither a carved solid, nor aggregate volumes within a continuous void, the interior rooms and exterior courtyards are both continuous, but meet only at their upper and lower corners.

Architects: FreelandBuck Location: Falmouth, Maine, USA Project Team: Brennan Buck, David Freeland, Kate ThatcherArchitects: FreelandBuck Location: Falmouth, Maine, USA Project Team: Brennan Buck, David Freeland, Kate ThatcherThe alternation of mass and void in plan is patterned on an imagined paranoic proliferation of deer stand hunting platforms throughout the forest. The resulting footprint is integrated with its site through porosity rather than topological continuity. The weave of exterior and interior space infuses the periodically occupied house with color and light that change hue and intensity with the seasons.

Text description provided by the architects. The design and building of Tree House was a labor of love. I designed this house for my sister, her first house. The death of our father allowed her the funds to build it. Tree House sits on a cul-de-sac at the end of a mature subdivision in Wilmington, DE, USA. It is filled with century-old deciduous trees, which form a magnificent canopy 150 feet above the site. A stream runs around the house, and because of certain restrictions of the Army Corps of Engineers and because of the potential for flooding, the buildable area is quite small. This induced us to design a vertical house, with raised Living Room and Master Suite. These spaces give one the feeling of being in the trees.

The stairs inside were fabricated at the performance stage shop where my sister works. They are made of 1/2" aluminum plate, with two treads in each unit.  Shades of purple set the color scheme: dark aubergine curtains, a grey-purple stone for the wall which encloses the fireplace and media storage. Horizontal windows encircle the house, providing select views into the landscape.   In contrast to these small views, a great wrapping window in the double-height Living Room provides a dominant diagonal focus for the house, and leads views into the deep woods to the northeast. A roof deck provides a view in all directions from a height of 35 feet in the air.

WoZoCo's Apartments for Elderly People open up 100 living units in an area of Amsterdam that has recently been threatened by the loss of green environments and spaces as a response to large increases in density. The solution found in this building is crucial to the firm's interest in being imaginative yet practical.

Stuck conforming to zoning regulations of the surrounding area, MVRDV calculated that only 87 of the proposed 100 units could fit the restricted footprint due to regulations about daylighting.

From this arose the idea of cantilevering the remaining units on the north facade, to connect to the transparent gallery of the main block found below while also opening up space on the rest of the site.

Structure is hidden inside the main block, found under the wood sheathing which projects a sense of instability between the connections of the thin walls that comprise the north facade.

Although striking and very poetic, the gesture created additional costs that had to be handled in shifting and cutting costs in the rest of the project in order to provide enough to pay for the cantilevered units. The main block features a more simple layout of seemingly random placement and sizing of windows and balconies on the southern facade. This is said to mimic the composition of the opposite facade but on a smaller scale.

Text description provided by the architects. Village Pointe East is one of Randy Brown Architects’ many responses to the strip mall. Brown sees strip malls as inevitable consequences of the suburban landscape. Instead of taking a utopian stance against them, Brown wants to do the best with the reality we live in.

Location 302/304 N. 168th Circle, Omaha, Nebraska USABrown’s aspirations aside, strip mall developers are just about as keen on incorporating Brown’s design ideas as architects are about designing strip malls. Thus to realize his vision, Brown with his father, brother, and brother-in-law formed their own development and management company, Quantum Quality Real Estate. This union between developer and architect has not only led to architectural accolades, but it has also brought about financial success, after the first 5 years their malls were 100 percent full and they had not lost one tenant.

The L-shape design utilizes the sloping site to create a lower level “walk-out basement” used by a daycare center. This maximizes the square footage and Quantum’s rental income. The building also has a pedestrian entrance to connect to the adjacent neighborhood.

Benches create spaces for customers to pause and wait outside for their appointments at the nail salon, dentist, doctor, beauty salon and the other strip mall tenants. Native grasses, ivy on chain link and crushed limestone have been incorporated into the design to soften the building.

Text description provided by the architects. The Mountain Lodge is a modern take of a traditional barn of the region in Härjedalen, Sweden. The Lodge comes as prefabricated wooden units. It was originally designed in 2005 by architect Peter Sahlin for his own family, as a vacation retreat in the fells of Härjedalen. Five houses have since then been produced in the region. The typical clients are urban professionals who desire a simple, compact, yet comfortable and modern vacation retreat.

The exterior's reduced and stern architecture lends it´s appearance from the simple barn-like architecture traditional in the fells of Härjedalen. The interior is modern and white. Warmth is added with wooden plywood walls and ceilings. One side of the lodge consists of large panoramic windows towards the winter mountain landscape or the greens of the summer. The lodge has full amenities including kitchen, bathroom, a sauna, two bedrooms and a loft with a third bedroom. Ecological and rational concerns have been important when choosing materials and construction methods - the lodge is very energy efficient and is built with sustainable and natural materials.The construction consists of a wooden framework and prefabricated wall- and roof elements. The Lodge is designed in two different sizes (85sqm and 100sqm) the smaller sized cottage (85sqm), costs about  200.000 Euros in Sweden, complete with all interior fittings.

Text description provided by the architects. The Thomas Haas Patisserie in Vancouver is the second retail location for Haas’s handmade chocolates and confections. Bricault Design was commissioned to design the original Haas factory / retail / cafe location in North Vancouver, as well as the moulds for the chocolate bars and award-winning packaging that occupy the space itself.

The second location builds upon earlier themes used in the original location, such as a signature graphic element which was derived from the molecular structure of theobromine - an essential component of the cacao bean. At the new location, the molecular motif inspires an extruded walnut ceiling system that descends into a display wall of Haas’ packaged products. The display wall seamlessly envelopes a refrigerated display case and washroom, while the cellular ceiling system is strategically integrated with lighting, sound, HVAC, and sprinkler systems.

The ceiling is composed of walnut ‘extrusions,’ which are backed by mirror. The downward extrusion contributes to an intimately-scaled space, while the mirror backing creates a sense of depth - a strategy employed to ameliorate the existing low ceiling on site. Materials such as terrazzo, walnut, and marble reference historical precedents, while the configuration of materials and fabrication techniques create an innovative take on the traditional patisserie. Bricault Design is based in Vancouver, Canada, and pursues projects in architecture, interior design, graphic design, and product development. Our collective background includes academic training in architecture, industrial design, and fine arts, as well as millwork and project management experience.

Text description provided by the architects. The Chemical Sciences  Building at Trent University is conceived as a promenade, both architectural and natural, that brings one into repeated contact with the Otonabee River, the central focus of Ron Thom’s Trent University campus. Designed by Teeple Architects, it is directly linked to the ground floor of the existing science precinct, and to its +15 circulation system. The promenade weaves between these two levels, presenting views of Trent’s unique river landscape to students as they move through the campus and the building. The river is the constant reference point, ever present in one’s experience of the place.

The building is tucked into the landscape, to allow the views to and from the Otonabee River to remain intact. The new Chemical Sciences Building at Trent University is intended to be both a respectful and innovative addition to Ron Thom’s Master Plan. By following the eroding contours of the landscape, the structure highlights its exceptional natural beauty. Instead of simply placing the building on the site, the building becomes part of the landscape itself, embodying a reverence for the topography that characterized the work of Ron Thom. The single storey building allows the land to literally extend over the roof of the building, blending natural and built form.

The project is organized to form a sequence of new courtyards on the campus; a rock court - cut into the hill, a court over the river, and an internal court formed between the CSB and the existing Environmental Studies building.

The project provides a highly regularized, flexible system of teaching labs that can be combined, as required, into various research projects. The ordered nature of the spaces stands in contrast to the sculpted complexity of the public space as it reaches outward to the river. The centre includes a 3,000 sqf. Water Quality Lab; which tests the conditions of the Otonabee itself, Teaching Labs, a Computational Lab, and High Level Research Labs. These are brought together in a shared social space, overlooking both courts. The laboratories accommodate the methodical pursuits of the researchers, while evoking the complex realm of intricate and unforeseen speculation.

Text description provided by the architects. Like pebbles in a stream smoothed by erosion, the Guangzhou Opera House sits in perfect harmony with its riverside location. The Opera House is at the heart of Guangzhou’s cultural development. Its unique twin-boulder design enhances the city by opening it to the Pearl River, unifying the adjacent cultural buildings with the towers of international finance in Guangzhou’s Zhujiang new town.

The 1,800-seat auditorium of the Opera House houses the very latest acoustic technology, and the smaller 400-seat multifunction hall is designed for performance art, opera and concerts in the round.

The design evolved from the concepts of a natural landscape and the fascinating interplay between architecture and nature; engaging with the principles of erosion, geology and topography. The Guangzhou Opera House design has been particularly influenced by river valleys – and the way in which they are transformed by erosion.

Fold lines in this landscape define territories and zones within the Opera House, cutting dramatic interior and exterior canyons for circulation, lobbies and cafes, and allowing natural light to penetrate deep into the building. Smooth transitions between disparate elements and different levels continue this landscape analogy. Custom moulded glass-fibre reinforced gypsum (GFRC) units have been used for the interior of the auditorium to continue the architectural language of fluidity and seamlessness.

The Guangzhou Opera House has been the catalyst for the development of cultural facilities in the city including new museums, library and archive. The Opera House design is the latest realization of Zaha Hadid Architects’ unique exploration of contextual urban relationships, combining the cultural traditions that have shaped Guangzhou’s history, with the ambition and optimism that will create its future.

Custom moulded glass-fibre reinforced gypsum (GFRC) units have been used for the interior of the auditorium to continue the architectural language of fluidity and seamlessness.The Guangzhou Opera House has been the catalyst for the development of cultural facilities in the city including new museums, library and archive. The Opera House design is the latest realization of Zaha Hadid Architects’ unique exploration of contextual urban relationships, combining the cultural traditions that have shaped Guangzhou’s history, with the ambition and optimism that will create its future.The Guangzhou Opera House has been the catalyst for the development of cultural facilities in the city including new museums, library and archive.

Back in July, we first introduced Aarhus, Denmark’s School of Architecture along with a cool temporary pavilion assembled from euro-pallets. Recently, three of the university’s students – Johan Stoustrup, Gustav Kragh-Jacobsen and Martin Erlandsson – have shared a creative video-project which focuses on the abstraction of fragmentation. Entitled ”Fragments of the Ideal City,” the video depicts the city as an constantly changing organism as different video clips project various images upon a lime plaster model set to music by Band Ane.Back in July, we first introduced Aarhus, Denmark’s School of Architecture along with a cool temporary pavilion assembled from euro-pallets.

Text description provided by the architects. The Arthur Rimbaud Media Library and Cultural centre was constructed in the context of the city of Anthony's urban renewal program. The city launched a public competition for the construction of a media library at Place des Baconnets with the aim of opening up the secluded Noyer Doré neighbourhood as well as offering cultural activities to the residents of this disadvantaged neighbourhood by promoting social interaction. The construction of the media library would be a symbol of the revival of the neighborhood.

Our response is a formally simplistic and easily identifiable building which contrasts, in both architecture and ambiance, with the surrounding buildings (the strict, sober and neutral forms of the surrounding residential buildings and the loud, playful architecture of the adjacent shopping centre).

We proposed a simple and bright architectural style designed to clearly convey the nature of the media library as a contemporary public facility, and a space of cultural circulation and recreation with its amenities open to the public.  The building might have otherwise appeared as a closed space, reserved for an initiated elite, demanding a commitment to regular attendance and as such, intimidating to the public. Our building expresses the ambitions of an attractive and vibrant media library, offering a variety of activities and events, a place where the public can stroll amongst the bookshelves and disc gondolas as well as see exhibitions or simply read books.

There has always been a steady flow of pedestrians at the site due to the central and strategic location of the land, with its proximity to the RER train station and the shopping centre, and this would naturally promote the use of the facilities, but the small size of the site was restrictive.  In order to ensure maximum floor space, we designed a slight cantilever to the first floor, using transparent facades of coloured glass in various sizes creating a dynamic appearance, making the building seem aerial and bright, straightforwardly presenting the contents of the building to passers-by, all this creating an important symbol for the neighbourhood. The facade of the first floor is mostly glass on three sides, and boasts a panoramic view of the Massy valley. In contrast, the ground floor is well-anchored to the ground, like basement, but with some areas of glass to clearly expose the contents of the media centre.

The north-facing facade of the media library is the largest, making its aspect ideal.  The entry of natural light is controlled by each façade: the south facade is completely blind, the north, west and east facades are treated as double façades on the first floor. The double skin acts as a buffer to control the natural evacuation of heat and reducing solar exposure to the interior glass walls. This also ensures excellent acoustics relative to external noise, which was a major consideration for the project mainly due to the noise of traffic at the intersection as well as that of passing trains.

We gave much attention to the roof of the media library which was treated as a fifth facade, considering its position and situation relative to the 14-floor existing residential building and the many direct views from this building on the roof of the media library. The option of a green roof was therefore ideal, making the roof a sort of “terrasse jardin”, rather than making it an afterthought simply attached to the adjacent building, while also providing benefits in terms of the environment, energy conservation and reduced maintenance.

Site Plan
The organisation of the library is simple and easy to understand. The separation of the public and private areas is well defined. From the ground floor entrance, we find the reception desk on the left,  multi-media and news media for adults on the right, while at the end of the hall a multi-purpose meeting room closes off the public area.  The private, administrative area is located behind this public area, with the two spaces separated by the large central concrete wall.  The stairway leads up to the first floor and its large two-story wall of vivid colour beckons the public upstairs and links the two floors using natural overhead lighting. This relationship between the two levels of the media library improves the organisational clarity of the public space. The first floor was designed as a large open area with a minimum of supporting walls allowing for the complete flexibility of the media library's reading areas and enabling the immediate understanding of the organisation of the first floor, which is reinforced with signs installed in the ceiling.

Text description provided by the architects. Once located along the riverfront, the Pencoyd Railroad Bridge was built in 1892 and closed in 1970. Led by BNIM, the recipient of the 2011 AIA National Architecture Firm Award, this historic bridge was relocated in 2006 to a new home where it became part of a new pedestrian link spanning the railroad artery separating the revitalized Crossroads district from popular civic destinations to the south.

Challenges included extracting the bridge from it’s original location, transporting it in one-piece through downtown and developing a design that would accommodate it’s new use for pedestrians, rather than rail traffic. The final design threads a pedestrian walkway through the existing trusses, while elegantly expressing movement through massing and materiality.

The view of the bridge from any angle, day or night, introduces a dynamic element into the urban context. However, its most important attribute is its connectivity for the community, providing safe and easy pedestrian passage to the area’s vibrant commercial, civic, retail and residential destinations.

Renewing and nurturing the physical and spiritual beings of men in need is the purpose of the CLC.  Men entering this program spend an entire year within the walls of this new facility. The program is a serious commitment, where the men exchange their former lifestyles for one of disciplined daily routine that is designed to help each achieve individual grow. The CLC is committed to providing an environment that is welcoming, nurturing, respectful, stewarding and comfortable for each individual and the CLC community.

The architecture has a role in helping each man’s journey succeed. Each individual has a unique beauty, and it was the design team’s intention to create an environment for the men that would reflect that beauty and evoke a welcoming presence and protective warmth. It was important that the design be appreciated slowly; just as the journey for these men is slow and deliberate, the architecture should follow. The CLC facility operates as a self-contained home for the men in the program. On the ground floor, they share community spaces for daily activities that build self-esteem, physical health, employment skills and spiritual relationships.  Sleeping spaces, showers and lounge areas occupy the second floor.

Given the issues of each individual, the CLC community and the connection to the outside world, the dynamics of privacy and community within the facility are complex, and strongly influenced the building’s and site’s design.  Balancing community and privacy required sensitivity due to the location of the site’s surroundings.  The new facility is situated in a neglected neighborhood near the urban core, making the creation of a safe and healthy environment paramount. The location and environmental conditions of the immediate surroundings—transient population, urban noise, light pollution, security and other externalities--suggested to the design team that a secure, quiet, heavy and internally focused building would best serve the needs of the CLC. The architecture responds to its context with a heavy protective public shell and a tactile and lighter private realm.  The public facades are load bearing masonry walls with modest fenestration delineating public and private spaces.   The composite masonry is normally bricked over CMU.  In specific areas the burnished CMU structure is exposed revealing the authentic structure—a nod towards the self-realization process of the men during their stay at CLC.  The courtyard and south walls are skinned in a rain screen system utilizing salvaged wood siding with generous windows providing visual connectivity, thermal comfort, ventilation and effective daylighting for the adjacent interior spaces. The building form is a compact two-story structure organized around an internal courtyard and second floor roof terraces. Programmatic spaces include a dormitory, living area, classrooms, recreation rooms, and administrative offices. A large- multi-purpose space is used for dining, recreation and worship.  The courtyard organization proved to be an appropriate bio-climatic approach for achieving overall comfort, sustainability and efficiency.  Every space and bed is afforded natural light and ventilation, resulting in the need for only modest electric lighting and geo-thermal mechanical systems.

Interior finishes are purposefully simple and restrained.  Where appropriate, structural systems are left without additional finishes or limited to sealants for protection or to ease cleaning.  Finishes include recycled wood and other sustainable products that contribute to the overall vision as a place of health and well being in all aspects of the men’s lives.  The floor and roof structure were deliberately selected to maintain the protective enclosure, isolating the interior from the urban environment.  Hollow core concrete planks were selected in lieu of lighter wood or steel options to ensure that quiet conditions could be maintained throughout all periods of the day. The site design includes public and private realms and incorporates a variety of sustainable features and is a showcase for urban stormwater management. The small site includes three bioretention cells that accept all of the roof’s run-off and there is no stormwater connection to the City’s sewer system. Indigenous plant materials that require low-maintenance have been integrated throughout the site.  Hidden from view are the geo-thermal wells and the recycled water storage tanks, which hold filtered water from the showers for use in toilet flushing.

BNIM’s intention was to embody a deep sense of timeless beauty within the building—a beauty beyond sensory perception that is derived from inspired architecture and a connection to nature.  The building embraces triple bottom line goals.  It is responsible to all inhabitants of the building, both residents and employees.  It embodies sustainable design intentions that are achieved through careful integration of the programmatic needs and design responses by all disciplines and systems.  Financial responsibility for this organization is a given.  The building strives to be frugal and use resources very sparingly a benefit that reaches well beyond the site and will have lasting impact for years to come.

Every space and bed is afforded natural light and ventilation, resulting in the need for only modest electric lighting and geo-thermal mechanical systems. The building form is a compact two-story structure organized around an internal courtyard and second floor roof terraces.

The courtyard organization proved to be an appropriate bio-climatic approach for achieving overall comfort, sustainability and efficiency.  Every space and bed is afforded natural light and ventilation, resulting in the need for only modest electric lighting and geo-thermal mechanical systems.Interior finishes are purposefully simple and restrained.  Where appropriate, structural systems are left without additional finishes or limited to sealants for protection or to ease cleaning.  Finishes include recycled wood and other sustainable products that contribute to the overall vision as a place of health and well being in all aspects of the men’s lives.  The floor and roof structure were deliberately selected to maintain the protective enclosure, isolating the interior from the urban environment.  Hollow core concrete planks were selected in lieu of lighter wood or steel options to ensure that quiet conditions could be maintained throughout all periods of the day.

The small site includes three bioretention cells that accept all of the roof’s run-off and there is no stormwater connection to the City’s sewer system. Indigenous plant materials that require low-maintenance have been integrated throughout the site.  Hidden from view are the geo-thermal wells and the recycled water storage tanks, which hold filtered water from the showers for use in toilet flushing.

Text description provided by the architects. The City of North Charleston approached BNIM and Burt Hill with one challenge - create a unique memorial dedicated to the thousands of their men and women, both military and civilian, who have risked their lives fighting for our country and citizens. Located on the grounds of the former Charleston Naval Base in Riverfront Park, the memorial is organized along a visual timeline using architecture, graphics and landscape to communicate the evolution of three naval vessels built over the course of the Base’s operational years: the Landing Craft, the Submarine and the Destroyer.

Exemplifying integration between architecture and graphics, this memorial provides an experience for visitors, drawing them into a naval scene and illustrating the naval culture that shaped the city, its people and those who were stationed at the former naval base. Inspired by naval vessels from the 1920’s, the monument consists of a shell of curving panels surrounded by water channels that enhance the visitors journey. Reflecting the materials and aesthetics of Navy ships, the structure and graphics use metal cladding and printed metal collages to tell the story.

The intent of the memorial is to honor those men and women, both military and civilian who have risked their lives fighting for our country and people, while at the same time allowing visitors the opportunity to interact and learn about the history of the former Naval Base. A visual timeline that captures the war era between 1901 and 1955 through the use of a photo collage, maps and typography, serve to inform the visitor about the base’s naval history. Materials include a Zinc fabricated structure. Iodized photos, typography and vector graphics were directly applied to the zinc plates. The photo collage was fabricated as one piece and bolted to shell.

Text description provided by the architects. From the project’s inception, Langara College was looking to address the educational and spatial needs of the school, as well as create a sustainable environment to incorporate the new Library and Classroom program. In addition to designing the building, Teeple Architects designed a master plan that offers a strategy to realize the environmentally responsible vision of the College’s future. The decision to create a LEED Gold Campus, supported by sustainable built and natural features, was the starting point for the overall Langara scheme.

Project Year 2007 The design philosophy is based on considering formal and environmental issues as one in the same.  The appearance, program and ecological features of the building all inform one another so directly, that they are indistinguishable.  Wind and rain warp the building’s roof, while Wind Towers are displaced vertically from the roof’s surface. The warped surface of the roof lifts the wind into the towers, pulling air through the interior spaces. Gardens and exterior public spaces push into the building, bringing greenery and daylight into the mass of the building and registering in its final figure.  The interior spaces respond to the environmental forces acting on and within the building as well. The main vertical circulation spine surrounds the Wind Tower voids, and in turn, forms the principle public interiors of the building.

The elimination of typical HVAC systems, and their replacement with geothermal heating and cooling in combination with natural displacement ventilation, results in a highly energy efficient building. A weather station on the roof senses wind direction, speed and humidity, and through a computerized control system, activates vent windows in the wind towers, which allow the wind to drive air through the building. This method is not only used as a substitute for conventional heating and air conditioning, it is the expressive force underlying the experience of the architecture.  Fresh air is brought into the building through a wind-scoop that becomes an iconic element in the new student quad. The air, contained in a duct ring, is tempered by passing through the underground parking, prior to entering the building. Interior climate control is further achieved through ground source heating and cooling, which adjusts the temperature of the building's concrete thermal mass.  The impact of these measures on energy use is significant.

The shape of the reflective roof gathers the rainwater into cisterns below the building, and then pumps the water back to irrigate the new landscape.  Storm water is processed through a sequence of bio swales along the west elevation. The swales are planted with vegetation and compost designed to remove silt and pollution from surface runoff. Inside the building, low flush toilets and waterless urinals reduce the water use by 30%. The primary building material is concrete. The concrete mixture includes recycled content, namely fly ash. Leaving the concrete completely exposed, the building requires little to no interior or exterior maintenance. Other materials include Low Emitting adhesives, sealants, paints, carpets and composite woods. The concrete thermal mass stores heat and significantly reduces the requirement for active heating and cooling systems. 10% of building is recycled content, which includes carpet tile, walnut doors and composite material in the millwork. Over 20% of the building materials are local and regional products, including the concrete, drywall and wood.

Text description provided by the architects. In a park in Stockholm, Urban Design have designed a new pumping station. The main aim of the project is to show how a infrastructure project can make a positive impact on the environment. The demand for new pumping stations in Stockholm are increasing because the power companies are expanding and connecting their district heating systems. This type of buildings are usually carried out as standard models but this time however, the power company Fortum in collaboration with the city of Stockholm have tried a new approach.

The park where the building is situated is a cultural heritage park, and hence, the client asked for building with a high architectural quality. Another condition was that it should be able to host the heating pumps and all it`s equipment above ground.

Text description provided by the architects. This project is a modern, urban two-unit townhouse designed by Zack | de Vito. Its construction consists of a 3-story wood frame structure over a concrete basement/garage. The site is a typical San Francisco lot, 26' x 115', with a moderate to steep upslope. The project was undertaken as a design build project with the Architect also being the owner and the general contractor. The North unit is the owner/architect’s home, and the South unit was sold. The design/build/develop strategy allowed the owners to build a new, modern home in the almost inaccessibly expensive Bay area housing market. The design build strategy also allowed an extraordianry amount of design freedom during construction, with details being worked out continuously through construction.

The program was for two townhouses consisting of side-by-side units, three floors over a basement/garage.  Each unit has a two car, tandem garage and a mechanical/storage room.  Unit A is +/- 2,530 sqf, 3 bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths, a family room and an entry/den, and an open plan Kitchen/Living/Dining Room, which opens out to a terraced rear yard.  Unit B is 1,800 sqf, and has 3 bedrooms, 3 baths and a full floor, open plan Kitchen/Living/Dining Room.  Both units also have a front deck over the garage.   Each unit has a dramatic, central stair connecting all of the levels.

There were three primary goals for the project:  First, to design an obviously modern building, but one that was also sensitive to the predominantly Victorian character of the neighborhood.  Second, the intent was to design two units that had equal access to the natural amenities of the site - light, air and views, as well has to have a clear, diagrammatically simple plan, but be spatially dynamic.  Third, as a design/build project, the goal was to take advantage of the extra-ordinary control this process allows, and be expressive in the use of materials, detail and craft.

While being clearly modern, the building has similar scale, massing and materials as its 100-year-old neighbors.  Its form is clearly of its time, but it also uses time-honored elements such as a bay window and the front garages with decks above.  Materials are also familiar, but used in a more contemporary, expressive manor.

The most distinctive characteristic of the project though is its plan and spatial configuration.  To allow side by side townhouses, a center dividing wall, angled from front to back, creates trapezoidal spaces, one end wide, one narrow.  The program was then adapted to best use the large and small ends of the space where appropriate.  The space is then divided in plan by a dramatic central stair, which allowed for changes in section, with some rooms taller than others.  The dynamic plan and section create lively, clearly organized and interesting spaces.

Plan
The center stair epitomizes the attention to craft and detail.  It is fabricated from water jet cut steel plate and precision cut, sanded acrylic.  It is a collection of pre-fabricated parts, assembled on site by our own crew of craftsmen.  It is structurally daring and the translucent steps and minimal structure flood all four levels with light.  The fabrication techniques take advantage of new technologies, while still allowing for the craft of the worker to be expressed.

The dynamic plan and section create lively, clearly organized and interesting spaces.The center stair epitomizes the attention to craft and detail.  It is fabricated from water jet cut steel plate and precision cut, sanded acrylic.  It is a collection of pre-fabricated parts, assembled on site by our own crew of craftsmen.  It is structurally daring and the translucent steps and minimal structure flood all four levels with light.  The fabrication techniques take advantage of new technologies, while still allowing for the craft of the worker to be expressed.The center stair epitomizes the attention to craft and detail.

Text description provided by the architects. MTV Networks’ personnel can rejoice: with the redesigned and newly organized reception, meeting and break room areas at MTV Headquarters, a long-held wish of employees becomes a reality and a once gloomy office complex on the Spree can finally function as the head offices. dan pearlman was asked to perform their magic and created an “axis of inspiration” by opening up the entire center area on the first floor from the northern to the southern façade. Today the spacious atrium serves as a “Brand Garden” with seating for taking breaks or informal meetings, which can accommodate up to 250 employees.

The interior design and materials relate to the identity of the MTV Networks (Germany) logo with its characteristic font and the colours dark brown, white, and yellow. They are referenced and translated creatively in the design of the reception area, the lobby, and the café as well as in the atrium and the kitchenettes.

Greater freedom of movement and an equal variety of unique as well as private retreat zones contribute to a better work-life balance at the workplace. Whether eating lunch in the Network Kitchen, in the Blue Lounge or in the Brand Garden under a stylized canopy of leaves, there are ample choices for taking time out during the workday. Fans of table tennis or table football can of course be found in the Sport Lounge. The abstract tree parasols and several different seating isles refer to the self-contained “corporate” design and use of materials in the entrance area. The overall picture of the “garden” is rounded up by the interaction of the large airspace- leaves installation and the “vertical green” spaces as well as small details, such as felt stones as open seating isles.

For the realization of the project dan pearlman mainly worked with the two executive companies “artis möbel objekte raumkonzepte gmbh” and “KRAUSS Baugesellschaft mbH Berlin”. The “KRAUSS Baugesellschaft mbH Berlin” (KRAUSS construction company) took the entire space-creating reconstructions of floors, walls and ceilings, from the color design to the implementation of the light. The “möbel objekte raumkonzepte gmbh” (furniture objects spatial-concepts company) realized the concept of the new work-life-balance at MTV with the whole interior decoration by stylish furniture and umbrellas. In addition, the entire team was supported by the Lindemann projekt.net GmbH & Co KG in researching and supplying the right furniture.

The B building reconnect the existing commercial activities of Sardegna street, hosting shops and services related to the intellectual activities.The articulation of volumes and the facade organization are related to the sustainability. The south front, on Uguaglianza street, is configured by a wide glass facade with high performance, which guarantees a fully radiance of the inside spaces. Moreover, on the south side the promenade ramps extend their surface to became green terraces with a significant solar radiation. The glass facade are protected from the direct solar light by a cantilever roof. On the north side, the facade is composed by concrete panels shaped with small rounded windows to prevent as much as possible the heat exchange. These rounded windows, together with the rounded relief, characterize the facade with a reminiscence of the ancient history of Macomer. The rounder relief want to celebrate the old sculptures typical of that area, the “betili mammellati”, of the XVI sec. a.C., which symbolize the fertility for the primitive population of Macomer.

This proposed sod house designed by Randy Brown Architects responds to the site and the history of Nebraska’s first settlers of European descent. In the early 1800’s, Nebraska was all open fields filled with native prairie grass. The first settlers were confronted with the challenge of what materials to build with. These pioneers built dugouts, or homes that were literally dug out of the side of hills. Exterior walls were slabs of sod stacked in a running board pattern.This proposed sod house designed by Randy Brown Architects responds to the site and the history of Nebraska’s first settlers of European descent.

Text description provided by the architects. Completed in 1957 for industrialist and philanthropist J. Irwin Miller and his family in Columbus, Indiana, the Miller House and Garden embodies midcentury Modernism in it's fullest. Architect Eero Saarinen's steel and glass composition has held together very well, proving the quality and use of materials to be worthy of time.

Not the first building designed for these clients by Saarinen, the initial intention of Miller and his wife was to create a year-round dwelling that could be used to entertain business guests from around the world, also doubling as a good environment to raise their children.

As head of Cummins Engine, was to create civic and institutional buildings in their town located 45 miles from Indianapolis, hoping to transform and reinvent into a hub of inventive design. Eero Saarinen worked with interior designer Alexander Girard and landscaper Daniel Kiley to best fulfill the ideas he had in mind for the house and garden.

An architectural tradition developed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, this house encompasses some of the most fundamental aspects of the international Modernist aesthetic, including an open and flowing layout, flat roof and vast stone and glass walls.Saarinen also included ideas of the main walls of public areas extending from floor to ceiling and cut out of marble several inches thick. The exposed edges eliminate a sense of separation between interior and nature through use of huge panes of glass.

It is located on a thirteen-acre rectangular site that stretches between a busy street and river. The plan acts as an organized rectangle divided into nine sections, the corners house the master bedroom suite, children's area, kitchen/laundry, and a zone encompassing the guest room, servant's quarters and a carport.

The children's rooms were designed with knowledge of standard children's rooms in Finland, where the private bedroom of each child was made small and functional and attached to a common playroom that tended to encourage social interaction.Totaling around 6,800 square-feet, the one-story house comprised of glass and gray-blue-slate panels is supported by steel cruciform columns and illuminated by a grid of skylights.

The interior designing of Alexander Girard creates an intimate and colorful experience, particularly in the living room's conversation pit. The dining area's sculptural white pedestal chairs become the center of focus while passing through or stopping to eat and enjoy the company.

Text description provided by the architects. The academy training grounds of the junior teams of Austria Vienna - one of the most traditional football clubs in Austria - lies close to the ‘Franz Horr Stadium’. they include a training hall and three grass pitches. the construction budget was extremely tight and the construction time limited to six months, and the handover date after completion a strict requirement in order to obtain the license of the Austrian Football League.Vienna building regulations set a maximum building height of 4.5 m and so the 7,0 m required clearance height in the training hall created an inevitable consequence: the entire building had to be lowered half below ground.

To assist the long-term refinancing of the construction budget, the principle of a football- advertising board has been turned inside-out: a big roof with a beam and parapet height of 2.0 m is the dominant design element. sponsors can advertise and demonstrate their support of junior teams on the popular Laaerbergstraße. The roof cantilevers out a few meters on all sides and forms a generous, weather-resistant perimeter for entrances and terraces. on the eastern wing, a compact roof construction over the storage spaces is utilised as a roof terrace, where coaches and visitors are afforded a clear view over the heated artificial pitch. The training hall forms the heart of the building and enjoys glare-free north light. the other sides are extremely compact and efficiently arranged - a cafeteria, offices, fitness rooms and massage and storage rooms. the access corridor on the ground floor works like a gallery to the sunken playing field. the required emergency escape for the offices and fitness rooms is organised in a series terraces. The sportshall with it’s artificial grass floor and birch plywood-impact protection walls provides the ideal atmosphere and a platform for concentrated training without distraction.

Low-temperature wall heating is utilised rather than conventional air heating. The artificial turf is carried through to the circulation zone which operates as a pre-warming buffer zone. all changing areas have natural daylight and direct access to the outside even though they are located in the basement. this is made possible because of the wide ramp that doubles up as a means of delivery and an ideal sprint training zone. Rainwater from the 2.500m2 roof surface is collected in large 120,000 liter tanks and serves as irrigation for the grass. the entire building is served by district heating.

Text description provided by the architects. Zellerndorf is a small town in the Weinviertel, not far from the Czech border. The client's parents own what is called a Streckhof here, which grew together out of several buildings with steep roofs and slanting ridges. It extends from a gateway on the street back to a barn and a pig pen at the rear of the yard and is where their two sons spend their childhood and youth. Robert Diem, the elder by one year, went to Vienna and became a policeman. At the age of 28 he decided to build his own house on a double site. "I have been saving up for ten years. My brother is an architect therefore a prefab house was out of question."

Two Danish Studios have been selected to compete in the prestigious competition to design Dublin’s new National Concert Hall. The two finalists were narrowed down from a shortlist of renowned architects from 2008. The two studios, 3XN and Henning Larsen Architects, delivered spectacular designs, which, unfortunately, will not be realized due to the cancellation of competition under Ireland’s fragile economic situation.Two Danish Studios have been selected to compete in the prestigious competition to design Dublin’s new National Concert Hall.

The new building provides a landscape for the urban and natural environment to harmonize as part of the architecture of the Concert Hall. 3XN’s proposal for the Dublin National Concert Hall is a sculptural showcase which creates a new home for music, while also providing a framework for the historical context upon which the new concert hall is situated. The new building provides a landscape for the urban and natural environment to harmonize as part of the architecture of the Concert Hall.The Dublin National Concert Hall is composed of three sculptural volumes, each of which contains its own unique Concert Hall. The three halls are connected at the Grand Entrance through the historic Butler building and via a plinth; with the organic foyer promoting flow and social interaction between the three halls. The foyer operates as a lively street, enhancing the interaction between the visitors to the three different concert halls. From the grand main entrance at Earlsfort Terrace through the floating foyers and down into the historic Iveagh Gardens, the city’s urban environment meets and transitions into the park. From the garden side, a transparent façade cascades down from the three Concert Hall volumes drawing the gardens forth into the foyer and extending into a new public plaza towards Hatch Street.

Hall 1 is designed to be reminiscent of the fine lines and interior of a fine classical wooden instrument; providing a warm intimacy between musicians and patrons. Hall 2 should be restored to its original glory with its classic layout and respect for tradition. Hall 3 is designed to be the most flexible and multi-functional of the three Halls.

SADAR + VUGA’s competition entry for the Intercity of Vienna, Austria is an urban redevelopment that stands as a symbol of quality architecture of the 21st century and one that uses the urban contextual history in its vision of the contemporary lifestyle. The site of this mixed use urban development is near the new railway station, which makes Intercity a node for newly arriving visitors to see Vienna through the context of the new architecture.SADAR + VUGA’s competition entry for the Intercity of Vienna, Austria is an urban redevelopment that stands as a symbol of quality architecture of the 21st century and one that uses the urban contextual history in its vision of the contemporary lifestyle.

In an effort to maximize its microclimate, this compact and graphic design is closed on the North side and open to the South. The closed side gives the pupils privacy from the street, while the open side looks onto a pleasant courtyard. Additionally, the bay windows are tripled glazed with argon strips to prevent against overheating in the summer months. These features complement the copper roof with photovoltaic panels, which currently produce more energy than is used.

The classrooms are regularly bathed in natural light thanks to the raising of the roof, which, by bending, attracts light from the East and North.

A Zero Carbon economy All industrial energy system inscribes its technological order into the urban fabric. What it’s the shape and what will be the urban footprint of the next ZERO CARBON energy economy? Which spatial implications for a “water city” like Boston? The key issue for this present challenge is how we can anticipate Fort Point Channel’s role in new Boston’s green future?A new water landscape That’s the Shift! Water is still the most appreciated elements of life and one of the most strategic urban resources for city development in a global zero carbon economy. The future of Boston is inseparable from the future of their bay and its waterfront. Water is a driving force that fundamentally shapes the whole character of the city. While the world is looking for possible alternatives to fossil fuels, water is also an unlimited source of energy. Indeed, hydrogen obtained from water hydrolysis has been touted as the basis of a new green energy economy. Our proposal envisions Fort Point Channel as a new Energy Infrastructure at the heart of a symbiotic strategy, irrigated by a brand new solar vessels system, connecting downtown’s commercial waterfront, with South Boston waterfront. Transforming the channel into a real dynamic water gateway, as an ecological infrastructure, it supports new leisure activities, restaurants, floating hotels, art galleries, displaying new water practices and encouraging citizens to help it to become the “next great place in the City of Boston” A new water landscape That’s the Shift!

The channel as an inner waterfront represent by its central position in Boston, and by its sheltered condition a great opportunity to create an urban hydrogen generator and at the same time a new great urban water place. HYDROMALL has been conceived as a completely integrated, energetic closed loop, using electricity from wind turbines and solar PV panels for producing and storing pure hydrogen. Thanks to the simple but effective superimposition of the “wind forest”, the “solar ribbons” and the “algae roof”. These three systems of energy harvesting are situated alongside the channel, and they taking advantage of architectural, landscape and urban potential of all of it, with a very few elements of a high technical accuracy, the proposal creates an open urban support to develop water activities and a new dynamic economical tissue for whole city.Hybridizing energy harvesting and urban space The proposal explores the value of an energy harvesting infrastructure as a design opportunity to catalyze Fort Point’s urban potential hybridizing economy with ecology.

Text description provided by the architects. The new flagship Campus for City of Westminster College by schmidt hammer lassen architects is designed to support new ways of teaching and learning. The 24,000m2 College, won in a competition in 2006, provides much greater amounts of open learning spaces than typical colleges in the UK and holds state-of-the-art facilities for both students and staff. The building is designed to embrace interaction and diversity and allow students to learn from each other, both formally and informally.

“The learning spaces of City of Westminster College are adaptable and flexible so that, in addition to the integrated technology, the students’ development is supported by the diverse architectural spaces of the very building they are in. It is a design which encourages new ways of teaching and learning,” says Founding Partner of schmidt hammer lassen architects, Mr Morten Schmidt. The College is located in the heart of Central London at Paddington Green on the site of its previous building, an inefficient and failing 1960s block. The building has been designed from the inside-out, responding to the needs of the diverse groups who use the College, as well as taking into account the sensitive local context. It appears as a clean-cut, modern building with a distinct Scandinavian heritage. The building’s simple geometric forms rotate around a terraced atrium, creating a unifying yet flexible organisation.

“The respective floor plans surrounding the atrium have visual connections from one floor to the other, making the atrium a dynamic centre and the heart of the College,” says Partner at schmidt hammer lassen architects Mr Kim Holst Jensen, and he continues:  “The large atrium, which on some floors extends all the way to the façade, enhances the relationship between the inside and the outside. It offers light-filled, open and inclusive spaces which encourage the interaction between students.”

To support connectivity with the local community, most public functions – including an exhibition area, a theatre and a café – are located adjacent to the main entrance before the security turnstiles. The choice of colours for the building is inspired by its context and by the change of the seasons, whilst the light timber panels lining the interior form a contrast to the exposed concrete surfaces and underline the Scandinavian design heritage.

The building is designed to be sustainable and energy efficient and the overall scheme will have a low maintenance liability, significantly reducing the building’s lifespan costs and carbon footprint. College Principal Keith Cowell says: “We wanted to create a new Campus with an open and inclusive atmosphere – a space that would match the needs of our diverse group of students. We're delighted with the outcome, and proud to be able to welcome people to such a contemporary and inspiring learning environment." The new City of Westminster College which opened to students on the 10th January 2011 is the first completed building by schmidt hammer lassen architects in the UK, soon to be followed by The Learning Zone – Library and Learning Centre in Sheffield and the University of Aberdeen New Library in Scotland both to be completed in 2011.

Text description provided by the architects. Located on a triangular parcel next to the entrance to the city, the Police Station is part of the creation of a new civic center close to the historic neighborhood.

The police station is on the edge of what is essentially a pavilions zone within proximity of the Northern gate to the medieval city of Provins. A site which, in 2001, was added to UNESCO's World Heritage List. This highly symbolic position gives the building an important status: it must maintain the continuity between the residential quarters of the North and the historic center of the South, and be worthy of such on all its faces, including when seen from above.

Text description provided by the architects. Hailed as one of China’s top 10 new urban landmarks NBBJ's design of Yanlord Landmark sets a new standard for high-end retail, work, and residential space in Chengdu. Yanlord Landmark was selected by the China Index Academy and China Index Research Institute as one of China’s Top 10 New Urban Landmarks two years in a row (2008-2009 and 2009-2010).Project description and images after the break.

Located in the heart of Chengdu’s Central Business District, Yanlord Landmark is a mixed-use development in what has become a key economic, transportation, and communication hub in Southwestern China. Designed as a premiere destination for life, work, and culture, Yanlord Landmark will serve the needs of a growing number of business delegates, both local and international. The prominent site – bordered by Renmin Nan Road, a major north-south city axis, on the west and situated between the Sichuan Exhibition Center and the Jin River – allows the complex to function as a landmark and focal point within the city.

The project consists of two towers containing offices and residential units that rise from a retail, entertainment and cultural podium.  The towers are oriented to maximize uninterrupted views and minimize solar exposure.

To balance developer goals with the client and city’s desire for an expressive architectural landmark, the design team based the tower forms on a simple and efficient floor plate.  The form and identity of the complex is created by the cladding of the simple tower volume in a glass façade articulated as a continuous wrapping surface.  Formally, the tower façade serves to unify the towers with the podium creating a single, cohesive architectural expression.  At the scale of the city this façade identifies the development within the city and along the skyline.  At street level, the façade folds out over the sidewalk welcoming residents, visitors, and office workers and defining major entry points.

The design of the site is based on the urban context and local traditions that celebrate the relationship between man and nature. The metaphor of water carving through the many valleys surrounding the city of Chengdu drove the design and configuration of the retail podium. Carved out niches became plazas, entries, or setbacks drawing the vibrancy of the city through the site. The porosity at the ground level activates the interior spaces of the site promoting an exciting and successful mixed-use environment.

Text description provided by the architects. Natural light, ample space and an inspiring environment are essentials “for architects to work properly”. All of those qualities are present within the courtyard and in the vicinity of an old block of housing in Smichov, Prague.

When several young architects looked for a suitable place for their new studio, they came across an old, shabby building that used to be a prison, then a lacquer’s workshop, a sculptor‘s studio and most recently a blacksmith´s workshop. Having been refurbished many times and lacking proper maintenance, there was little left of the original, historically valuable building.

After surveying and some evaluation, a decision was made to demolish a substantial part of the old building.  The one-storey, U-shaped building was turned into a two-storey structure with a simple rectangular outline.

It‘s ground floor houses a meeting room, a model-making workshop and toilets. The large, open-space atelier is placed on the upper floor.  All of the spaces are naturally lit by strip windows facing the courtyard and by a linear skylight.

The studio is placed at rear of the courtyard, which is accessible from the street by a passage through the old block of flats. The three stone and brick walls that were left from the original building are placed at the edge of the courtyard. The new structures, framed with solid wood timbers, were inserted in to the space defined by the old walls. The cladding between the wooden bearing members was made of fire-resistant cement panels.

Thanks to its constrained position between the stone walls, the building has only one open facade facing the courtyard. Semi-transparent resin and fibreglass corrugated panels were used for cladding and for the shallow sloping lean-to roof. The light-weight character of the building envelope contrasts with the old heavy stone walls and goes hand-in-hand with the interior concept, based on the visible-bearing-structure principal. The internal room of the penthouse is thus mentally and physically interconnected with the external courtyard space.

Text description provided by the architects. The Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis is located in a neighborhood of empty lots, burned out churches and lone townhouses that mark a lost twentieth-century urban ideal. The original grasslands of the region have reemerged in the form of manicured lawns that course between the lone remnants of elegant town homes, creating a new form of urban frontier.

The new architecture for the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis creates a “site” for art and the potential work of artists, work that can take any form or medium. A building of anticipation, the museum is intended to be “acted upon” with art on any plane or surface.

It is a catalyst for new experience, an instrument to be played by artists and curators. In creating this new domain for art, the architecture reinforces both the ghost of the ideal city streets and the present landscape.

The museum is formed by two opposing walls of concrete, which intertwine and cantilever over this new urban prairie. The lower walls bound the museum and establish the realm for art, observation, and education, creating large interconnecting galleries. These serpentine walls touch the sidewalk and fold inwards, inviting the public to enter and providing views completely through the building from the street intersection outside. The upper walls span above the galleries, intersecting and dividing the volumes below while providing rooms for administration and education. The ceilings float between these upper boundaries at varying heights, modulating the proportion and light of the galleries. The two realms of space and structure converge and diverge, spinning the perception of enclosure and transparency in multiple directions.

This building is a simultaneous act of enclosure and invitation, allowing the landscape to flow through the entire site, while tenuously capturing and containing rooms for art. The museum is not a privileged domain, but an open field that concentrates the forces of the city in preparation for later occupation by the artists.

Text description provided by the architects. The site for this project was within an abandoned warehouse that fills a city block. This allowed the Wieden+Kennedy advertising agency to occupy a single building for the first time in many years. The original 1908 building formed a solid, five-story masonry mass with little light - a perforated box filled with a gridwork of heavy timber and quartered by cruciform masonry walls.

The first act of architecture was one of distinction: preserving and restoring the historic warehouse. Against this neutral ground of workspace, a five-story concrete building rises within the cleared center of the block. This new construction concentrates seismic forces, daylight, and collective activity into a single room—a building of pure space, not form; with no elevations, no distant views, no front or back—it is embedded architecture.

Emerging from the street you arrive deep within the building in a space filled with light, activity, and energy. The heart of the city block has been taken apart and reassembled to accommodate concerts and events amid the hum of the workplace. A building that appears divided by the juxtaposition of old and new, by the layering of light and structure, it is woven together again by two totemic columns holding walkways that radiate through the center space. From above, light filters into the heart of the space, reflected and diffused by the timber structure of the enclosing penthouse.

The building is one of inversion, continually collapsing upon itself, from exterior to interior and exterior again, from public to private then public once more. At its center is a single room, a transparent mass that seems to expand infinitely beyond its concrete boundaries.

A building that appears divided by the juxtaposition of old and new, by the layering of light and structure, it is woven together again by two totemic columns holding walkways that radiate through the center space. From above, light filters into the heart of the space, reflected and diffused by the timber structure of the enclosing penthouse.The building is one of inversion, continually collapsing upon itself, from exterior to interior and exterior again, from public to private then public once more. At its center is a single room, a transparent mass that seems to expand infinitely beyond its concrete boundaries.The building is one of inversion, continually collapsing upon itself, from exterior to interior and exterior again, from public to private then public once more.

As a finalist for the Torres De Cotillas Competition, STL Architects shared with us their proposal for the new Auditorium and Arts Center within the future office park. The design is projected to become the key element of connection between the new urban space and the consolidated old town grid. The new building will become a symbolic reference of public activity that will be established around the future office park of Torres de Cotillas, Spain.

Given its proposed location, the new Auditorium and Arts Center is intended to become an inviting activity center that will establish a new connection between the consolidated old town of Torres de Cotillas and the recently designed office park complex.In order to solidify this connection we propose for the new Auditorium and Arts Center to become a 24-7 activity center. This will be achieved through the creation of an outdoor public agora that will double the activity levels of the originally required program. Located in the upper level of the building, the space will be able to hold concerts, social events and public meetings.

However, the austere nature of its exterior facade is balanced by the open, light filled spatial qualities of the interior. Due to the current depleted condition of its surroundings the building adopts a decisively introverted architectural expression. However, the austere nature of its exterior facade is balanced by the open, light filled spatial qualities of the interior.The building’s structure is conceived entirely of concrete. The exterior perimeter walls are designed as a double layer of reinforced concrete. Gravity loads originated by the public space in the upper level are distributed through a series of radial concrete beams forming the horizontal support assembly. Additionally, a series of concentric circular concrete elements form the seating platforms for the upper public space. The interstitial space created between them provide an opportunity for the formation of a continuous clerestory ring that fills light into the large ground floor public spaces.

These penetrations will be created using a system of solid glass elements embedded within the concrete wall itself. During the day the wall allows light to filter through to the interior of the building while at night time the building presents a very different expression. The small, randomly placed penetrations will glow emphasizing both the building’s role as a community beacon and its condition as a 24-7 activity center.

The thinking of architectural design of SPSI Art Museum is to start from environment and architecture itself, and to find the result during the process of answering the basic architectural questions. The final result even surprised our-selves. The effect of its volume, space, material and structure has touched us deeply, which turns out to be a kind of pure power.

Design of new Art Museum has set up clear volume parallel to the street and cancelled the fences, in order to create complete open entrance space between the city and building, which is much more reachable and public.

Like a polygon form stone lies the Museum along Jinzhu Road, calm and angular, simple but powerful, which rescues people from decorating facade of neighborhood.

The wall between Museum and its neighbor East Center had to be remained. A piece of alone standing wall cannot form the feeling of volume, which is uncoordinated to the Museum main volume. We decide to continue the wall back into the main body of Museum, so that it creates a impressive entrance space and at the same time a nice inside garden, which supplies good view for the VIP room on the first floor.

The refurbishment of the Reg Bartley Oval Grandstand at Rushcutters Bay in Sydney required restoration of the existing grandstand and the construction of new public amenities and ground staff facilities.

The brief included demolition of three buildings that surrounded and attached to the grandstand, cutting it off from the street and parkland behind.The design strategy was to restore the existing structure’s prominence in the parkland and create better physical and visual connections around it.  In order to minimize the impact of the new additions, they are placed directly behind the grandstand and divided into 3 smaller buildings instead of one building, reducing the overall bulk and scale.  The new buildings are set off the grandstand with a passageway between them.  Connection between the new and the old is on the first floor via a steel mesh walkway that lightly bridges the four buildings allowing light to filter below. The ancillary buildings are clad in the same weatherboard profile as the grandstand and with the heights of the new buildings aligning with the grandstand; they echo the scale and expression of the grandstand.

Text description provided by the architects. The new city library in Turku is located at the historical centre of the city. The building is the latest addition to a block with the old library and several other historically valuable buildings. The historical and cultural value of the site presented a great challenge for the planning of the new building. The objective of the project was to create a new construct, which would harmonize with the historically invaluable setting while also manifesting an architecture of its own age. In terms of urban planning the goal was to fill out the open and unstructured street corner by following the edges of the existing urban grid. By constructing the building on the outer perimeter, we were able to provide an open space in the middle of the lot, which was designed to serve as a courtyard for recreation and a stage for cultural events. The interior of the new building is annexed with the existing 100-year old library building and the chancellery of the governor built at the beginning of the nineteenth century, now restored and transformed to facilitate a café and meeting rooms.
Save this picture!
The new library has a functionally clear design. The public spaces are situated mainly on two floors surrounding the opening to the courtyard. The staff premises are located systematically on one side of the building facing the street. The new main entrance opens onto the corner of two main streets. The first floor has a reception and lounge area, a children's and youth section, and a modernized version of a periodicals reading room called the news market, which functions simultaneously as the link between the new library and the old buildings. The main room of the new building is reached through a main stairway, which opens to a monumental space containing the non-fiction stacks and reading areas. The guiding principle in the space planning was flexibility; the functions of the library may change radically in the future with the introduction of new media. The rooms are open, and the functions are limited only by the transformability of the easy-to-move furniture. 
Save this picture!
The materials of the building were chosen to accommodate the environment. The facades are mainly plastered, which is the predominant material of the old buildings in the block. Initially we considered using red brick, but gave up the idea to allow the old library building to remain the only brick building on the block thus emphasizing its primary position in the neighbourhood. We also used natural stone extensively on the facades, the stairway and the grounds surrounding the building. In the interior we used mostly European Oak in the wall furnishing and furniture. The structure of the building was made from concrete cast on site, which was left exposed as an important part of the interior design. The fair-faced concrete was formed with vertical boards to achieve the rough feeling characteristic of the material. Glass was given a seminal role both in the outer architecture and the interior world. From the first steps of the planning process it was clear that the exuberant use of glass would be the best choice. Transparency befits this type of building; a public library building should evoke the idea of openness.

The basis of the planning was to create a new library to meet up with the challenges of the future. At the same time, the library has a long and rich history, which the architecture should also take into account. The architectonic whole is formed from the union of these two oppositions, the past and the future.

The volume containing the workrooms and teaching rooms is designed to be simple, flexible, and functional. Somewhat like an industry building where students and teachers can experience a professional environment. The big north-facing sheds guarantee the perfect light for any training activity and the closed working spaces help capture the attention.

Text description provided by the architects. As part of an international competition to design Boston’s City Hall in 1962, three Columbia University professors, Kallmann, McKinnell & Knowles, diverted from the typical sleek, glass and steel structures that were being requested by popular demand. Rather than basing their design on the material aesthetics, their goal was to accentuate the governmental buildings connection to the public realm.

Completed in 1968, the Brutalist style city hall bridges the public and private sectors of government through a gradient of reveal and exposure that allows the public to become integrated, either physically or visually, into the daily affairs of the governmental process.
Save this picture!
Unlike many of the other entries for the competition that implemented glass and steel in their modernist designs, Kallmann, McKinnell, and Knowles used rough beton-brut concrete to contrast from the modernist designs that were proliferating throughout the United States and Europe at the time. 
Save this picture!
They strove for an architecture that was involved with its social, cultural, and political context where the one can understand the methods behind the design, both programmatically as well as construction methods.  The result is a concrete, tripartite design that stratifies the public from the administrative.
Save this picture!
The city hall is divided into three main entities that make up overall system.  Its division, both volumetrically and programmatically, is essentially a division of public and privatized spaces that are emphasized such that as the building tapers into a cantilevering system, the more private aspects of the city government are directly related.
Save this picture!
From the street, there is a large open plaza that separates one from the main entrance to the city hall. For Kallman, McKinnell, and Knowles, the plaza was supposed to be an extension of the main floor of the building, which becomes suggested as the plazas brick pavement begins to transition into the lobby’s quarry tile. In effect this subtle transition becomes a means by which the city hall is able to establish a relationship between the public sector and the everyday affairs of the government.
Save this picture!
As the building continues to taper out, the building becomes more of standardized, bureaucratic façade system, which directly relates to the work happening within. At the uppermost floors where the mayor’s office workers are located, the façade system is structured on a monolithic scale appearing as an ancient triglyph the wraps the perimeter of the building.
Save this picture!
At the heart of the building is where the strict façade system becomes broken and articulated so that moments in the building are revealed to those in the plaza. 
Save this picture!
These protrusions and breaks in the façade are meant to be the ways in which the public can visually become part of the day to day activities within the mayor’s office.  It’s this juxtaposition and new spatial protrusions that are constantly recreating the relationships between the government and the people where either physically or visually the two are always connected.

Since the Boston City Hall has been completed, it has had a mixed review from the citizens of Boston, architects, and even the mayors of Boston.

plan_01
In 2006, the mayor of Boston had actually filed a petition to have the building destroyed in order to make way for a better, more efficient building that was “aesthetically pleasing.” However, since that has happened, a group of activists have been able to have the city hall given a special landmark status that prohibits any future modifications until it can be granted full landmark status.

plan_02
“We distrust and have reacted against an architecture that is absolute, uninvolved and abstract. We have moved towards an architecture that is specific and concrete, involving itself with the social and geographic context, the program, and methods of construction, in order to produce a building that exists strongly and irrevocably, rather than an uncommitted abstract structure that could be any place and, therefore, like modern man— without identity or presence." – Kallmann

Rather than basing their design on the material aesthetics, their goal was to accentuate the governmental buildings connection to the public realm.Completed in 1968, the Brutalist style city hall bridges the public and private sectors of government through a gradient of reveal and exposure that allows the public to become integrated, either physically or visually, into the daily affairs of the governmental process.Completed in 1968, the Brutalist style city hall bridges the public and private sectors of government through a gradient of reveal and exposure that allows the public to become integrated, either physically or visually, into the daily affairs of the governmental process.Unlike many of the other entries for the competition that implemented glass and steel in their modernist designs, Kallmann, McKinnell, and Knowles used rough beton-brut concrete to contrast from the modernist designs that were proliferating throughout the United States and Europe at the time. Unlike many of the other entries for the competition that implemented glass and steel in their modernist designs, Kallmann, McKinnell, and Knowles used rough beton-brut concrete to contrast from the modernist designs that were proliferating throughout the United States and Europe at the time. They strove for an architecture that was involved with its social, cultural, and political context where the one can understand the methods behind the design, both programmatically as well as construction methods.  The result is a concrete, tripartite design that stratifies the public from the administrative.They strove for an architecture that was involved with its social, cultural, and political context where the one can understand the methods behind the design, both programmatically as well as construction methods.  The result is a concrete, tripartite design that stratifies the public from the administrative.The city hall is divided into three main entities that make up overall system.  Its division, both volumetrically and programmatically, is essentially a division of public and privatized spaces that are emphasized such that as the building tapers into a cantilevering system, the more private aspects of the city government are directly related.The city hall is divided into three main entities that make up overall system.  Its division, both volumetrically and programmatically, is essentially a division of public and privatized spaces that are emphasized such that as the building tapers into a cantilevering system, the more private aspects of the city government are directly related.From the street, there is a large open plaza that separates one from the main entrance to the city hall. For Kallman, McKinnell, and Knowles, the plaza was supposed to be an extension of the main floor of the building, which becomes suggested as the plazas brick pavement begins to transition into the lobby’s quarry tile. In effect this subtle transition becomes a means by which the city hall is able to establish a relationship between the public sector and the everyday affairs of the government.From the street, there is a large open plaza that separates one from the main entrance to the city hall.

Since the Boston City Hall has been completed, it has had a mixed review from the citizens of Boston, architects, and even the mayors of Boston. In 2006, the mayor of Boston had actually filed a petition to have the building destroyed in order to make way for a better, more efficient building that was “aesthetically pleasing.” However, since that has happened, a group of activists have been able to have the city hall given a special landmark status that prohibits any future modifications until it can be granted full landmark status.In 2006, the mayor of Boston had actually filed a petition to have the building destroyed in order to make way for a better, more efficient building that was “aesthetically pleasing.” However, since that has happened, a group of activists have been able to have the city hall given a special landmark status that prohibits any future modifications until it can be granted full landmark status.“We distrust and have reacted against an architecture that is absolute, uninvolved and abstract. We have moved towards an architecture that is specific and concrete, involving itself with the social and geographic context, the program, and methods of construction, in order to produce a building that exists strongly and irrevocably, rather than an uncommitted abstract structure that could be any place and, therefore, like modern man— without identity or presence." – Kallmann“We distrust and have reacted against an architecture that is absolute, uninvolved and abstract.

Text description provided by the architects. The clients of this 1954 bungalow asked Randy Bens Architect to add a new floor to the existing structure. Located in a post war suburban neighborhood that sits at the prow of a hill in New Westminster, British Columbia, the bungalow is surrounded by rich modernist architecture from that era. The existing house was an L-shaped bungalow that was too small for the clients, an artist and psychologist, who have three boys ages 17 to 26. The new floor would be the domain of the parents, and the boys would acquire main floor bedrooms of a more suitable size. The addition would be composed of a studio, master suite, and a deck to take advantage of the view. Architecturally, the goal was to knit together the old and new with simple gestures and materials that would be sympathetic to their context, yet fresh.

The overall massing was influenced by the desire to stack the new program on existing walls (where possible), and by the creation of a new exterior space on the second floor with access to views and sunlight.

To counter the vertical nature of the resulting mass, and shade the south facing living room, a horizontal screen was introduced which gives the composition a more restful and balanced appearance.  The screen extends past the living room in both directions, creating a covered entry to the east and an open structured space to the west, where there will be a stand of bamboo.  To further reinforce the horizontality of the screen, a concrete planter / plinth / address wall was introduced at the ground plane.

There was a strong desire to have the house respond to the 1950’s and 1960’s post and beam houses in the neighbourhood.  The vertical cedar siding, gently sloping roofs, exposed glulam beams and rafters are all present, but contemporary in their composition.

To give the facades order and cohesion, two devices were used to mediate between existing and new openings.  Bright rolled zinc panels were placed above and beside existing window openings, then aligned with new openings above.  A simple through-wall flashing detail serves as a datum for window heads, mullions and sills, and is present on all facades.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is constructing a new facility to replace the existing NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) located in La Jolla, California, which is threatened by continuing bluff erosion. Designed by Gould Evans, the new facility will include approximately 124,000 sqf with an additional 90,000 sqf of under building parking, and is located on a site east of the existing SWFSC property. The proposed 3.305 acre site enables NOAA to continue its long-term partnership with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) of UC San Diego, but constrains the design, construction and available development due to its steep grade.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is constructing a new facility to replace the existing NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) located in La Jolla, California, which is threatened by continuing bluff erosion.

Text description provided by the architects. The site is located at Coles Bay on the east coast of Tasmania, and overlooks Great Oyster Bay, the Hazards and the Freycinet Peninsula.Our brief was for a intimate luxury resort, of 20 private suites that was is intended to be a destination in its own right and mainly cater to inbound interstate or international - guests. It will provide for (and possibly create) a new high end tourist market in the state. Also important to the client was that the project had an iconic, highly recognizable form that also related to the natural site.

Although the resort is located within what is extensively a natural native costal landscape, the project site was scarred from its previous use as a disused caravan park. The project became as much about repairing the site and interpreting its unique qualities as it was about creating a space from which it could be experienced.

The resort is organic in its relationship to the site and is intentionally evocative of costal forms. However, the form also works with the programmatic requirements of the brief. Essentially the main resort building (or Sanctuary) is entered from the tail and when inside opens into a large volume that provides a panoramic view of the Hazards and Great Oyster Bay. The reception lounge is on this level with the mid level containing bar, restaurant and lounge areas and lowest level gallery, board room and day spa. Undercover walkways, link the reception building to the suites which are spaced to reveal views through. The Hazards are a dominate feature of the site and the architecture deliberately blocks and reveals views throughout the whole journey.

One of the main challenges of the design was to reconcile the client (and market’s) perception of luxury and still capture elements of the unique Tasmanian context. The view is important part of this, however, materials, colors, scale and form also contribute strongly. Materials were selected to work on many levels - pragmatic reasons (such as built form, availability and remote construction), their aesthetic associations (vernacular style, natural context, or luxury expectations) and to extenuate spaces or volume. This was reinforced by a color pallet that was sampled from a close examination of the surrounding landscape. Furthermore, the grandness of the main resort building, which response to the larger context, is counteracted by a more personal and intimate scale in the suites.

Where possible issues relating to sustainable design were considered however this was also balanced against construction issues on a remote site and market expectations for luxury resorts (both in material selection and building services). A major consideration for the project was water usage in what is typically a drought affected area. New rain water collection & storage infrastructure were built (off site) as part of the project for use by the development and the nearby township as well as sewage treatment facilities. Rainwater from roofs is also collected and re-used in the reflection pools, as well as water efficient devices being specified. Another important factor, due to the predominately cool climate and south facing site, was heating the resort. All buildings are well insulated and high performance glazing was installed. Energy efficient water heating and air conditioning systems were used.

The Lighthouse Christian School (LCS) was a beacon of goodwill even after a deluge washed away its pre-school in May 2010. Although few had lost more than the school community, LCS leaders hung a banner amid the ruins that read, “Southeast Nashville Recovery. How can we help?” The Lighthouse Christian School (LCS) was a beacon of goodwill even after a deluge washed away its pre-school in May 2010. Although few had lost more than the school community, LCS leaders hung a banner amid the ruins that read, “Southeast Nashville Recovery. How can we help?”“At their time of greatest need, the LCS community was helping other flood victims rebuild their homes, so it was an easy decision, an honor actually, for us to give them a hand,” says architect John Abernathy, founding partner at DA|AD of Nashville. Abernathy and his firm were recruited to design and oversee the pre-school building’s resurrection, featured on the popular US TV show “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.”“At their time of greatest need, the LCS community was helping other flood victims rebuild their homes, so it was an easy decision, an honor actually, for us to give them a hand,” says architect John Abernathy, founding partner at DA|AD of Nashville. Abernathy and his firm were recruited to design and oversee the pre-school building’s resurrection, featured on the popular US TV show “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.”Because of the urgent need and the show’s tight production schedule, speed was of the essence in designing the replacement school. Abernathy’s team brought sketches to the introductory meeting with the show’s Production Designer, then delivered 3D digital models the next day featuring what would become the school’s signature schoolhouse-style gable shapes. The team went on to perform six months’ worth of design work in five weeks, then stayed on site around the clock during the construction week.

Not only did we need concepts and details in those five weeks, but also mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection, civil engineering, and landscaping designs. You have to think fast, get it right the first time, and move on.” “Hundreds of challenges go into a project like this,” says Abernathy. “Some you anticipate, some you don’t, but deadline pressure was the biggest one. Not only did we need concepts and details in those five weeks, but also mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection, civil engineering, and landscaping designs. You have to think fast, get it right the first time, and move on.”Fortunately, DA|AD had upgraded to high-productivity building information modeling (BIM) design software from GRAPHISOFT. Rather than creating building designs in two dimensions, drawing by drawing, the firm was now using GRAPHISOFT’s ArchiCAD to take a visual 3D approach, with dimensions and a wealth of other data packed into each feature, and with construction drawings automatically generated from the model. By working visually and letting the 3D model handle the bulk of the drawing work, DA|AD was able to deliver far more than producers and builders expected much earlier in the process.

That took less than 10 minutes in ArchiCAD. “With ArchiCAD, you just add the windows and they show up in all the drawings. Everything makes sense. The job would have taken hours in 2D software. ArchiCAD helps our accuracy as well. In BIM, there are a lot of mistakes that are virtually impossible to make. If you mess up dimensions, the building simply won’t go on the foundation and it will be painfully obvious. You can get pretty far down the wrong road in 2D and not know it.” Two and a half weeks into the design process, the DA|AD team saw an opportunity to improve the project by adding diagonally stacked windows to the preschool’s playroom space.

It includes an art gallery, restaurant, a Mexican popsicle shop, neighborhood grocery, photography studio, graphic design studio, flats, townhouses, and the ultimate compliment – a competing architect who liked the space so much he moved his firm in.

You end up with a three-story building that, by all appearances, is a two-story building that does not dominate the street. One advantage of ArchiCAD digital models is that you know what you’re going to get from your design. You can play with forms and planes and push them back and forth, fully visualizing, versus imagining, what will actually be built. We knew the third floor would be discrete.” One of 12th & Paris’s signature accomplishments was integrating three stories of space into a neighborhood of two-story buildings. “We pulled it off by creating chest-high parapet walls and tugging the third floor back, making the third floor invisible from the street,” says Nick Dryden, DA|AD’s other founding partner. “Moving the third story back wasn’t really a tradeoff because the by-product was a wonderful outdoor penthouse deck for each townhouse.

The team has increasingly tightened its collaboration using ArchiCAD Teamwork to enable multiple designers to work simultaneously. “We ‘Teamworked’ the pre-school from start to finish,” Abernathy said. “There were a lot of us doing a lot of different things.” ArchiCAD Teamwork enables collaboration on models over a local network or the Internet so that architects -whether working as an intimate team in a boutique firm like DA|AD or in a much larger concern- can collaborate at work, from home or on the road.Successes like these have inspired DA|AD to further explore BIM software’s potential for improving design practices.

One of the unique elements of the Lighthouse Christian School is the illuminated pillar at the new school’s entrance. It is a backlit shining beacon engraved with the words joy, trust, serve, inspire, hope, friend, teach, heal and love. Abernathy and his team built it by hand. At night, the words bathe the entire facade, not far from where the how-can-we-help banner once hung.Though a cohesive team, DA|AD stays agile, refusing to conform to a signature style and delivering unique solutions for every client.

Text description provided by the architects. Located on an irregular lot, the house sits at the back of the lot and is parallel to one of the streets to open the best orientation and capture the best views.  The idea of this journey was to discover the entrance as we follow the exterior stone wall.  The rustic and crafted stone defines and separates the entry zones from the living spaces and is inside and outside, proposing a counterpoint to the pure white that dominates the inside of the house.

A blind and evocative entrance makes a strong impression on the house.  The white of the carrara marble dominates the interior architecture.  With the white walls and ceilings, the house appears to arise from within the water.  The touches of color are used for small details and decorative objects, dominating the white color and the turquoise of the water. The water that surrounds the house penetrates it in the form of the mirrored surface of the water whose novelty results in the interior cascade that emerges from the top floor and falls while painting reflections via a pane of glass.  This mirror of water is reproduced outside blurring the boundaries between one and the other.  Finally, emerging from the hall dispenser of the top floor, the glass cascade drains musically into and through the heart of the ground floor.  These elements give the project the distinct mark of Remy--bold, creative and perhaps provocative, but always unique.

Text description provided by the architects. Completed four years after architect Mies van der Rohe's passing, the IBM Building became one of the cities most prestigious addresses. A pure symbol of the architecture of the time, the almost 700 foot tall rectangle sits on a raised plinth that helps it to maintain a uniform height given the unevenness of the site; State Street to the structure's west inclines steeply.

As architecture, the IBM Building, along with many others designed by Mies van der Rohe, becomes synonymous with corporate power.

Black anodized aluminum and gray-tinted glass are used together to create a uniform skin that gives the appearance of a single imposing and impressive volume. It's strength and clarity of form are distinguishable and appreciated along the Chicago skyline, a tribute to the lifelong study of structural expression, organizational scale, material simplicity, proportion, and constructive detail.Positioned on a riverside site, the IBM Building is open to views of the lake, and is very striking to passerby crossing over the river. It marks one of the last American buildings done by Mies van der Rohe, and also the tallest of all his buildings at 670 feet.

His participation in it's construction was comprable to that of an  observer, as he was growing older and even passed away a year before the completion of the structure.In it's initial context, the IBM Building dominated it's surroundings, including the lower Chicago Sun-Times building to the east. This building was torn down and instead sits an under-construction behemoth of Donald Trump, standing 1,100 feet tall which may arguably block many of the views from the IBM Building.

Recent news about the building has been centered around the conversion of the office building into residential rentals as IBM left for other quarters. This left the building with a new name, 330 North Wabash, and new intentions as a downtown building in Chicago.

Currently 36% of the building's space is not in use, and within a few years another 16 floors will empty as a result of the anticipated move of law firm Jenner and Block.

The current plan is to convert floors 3 through 14 into about 275 condos, and continue on with the conversion as more floors become vacant. Although sales prices are around half of those for the high-end Trump units that are right next door, the fact that the IBM is now blocked in by taller structures along the east and west facades may make it more difficult to sell.

Although as it once was, the IBM Building has not yet been declared an official landmark, meaning that there still is not legal protection against dramatic or destructive alterations.

The elevation of the bridge is defined by the clearance space required by the light-rail. Thus, the walk-way leads at clearance height through the tree tops along this highly frequented but beautiful tree- lined boulevard with multiple hinged supports along the way.

Abut- ment points, where the bridge is supported on bearing plates to place it on the ground, occur on both sides of the road. On each face side, set against the bridge, there are elevators that stand as soli- taries to delineate the structure. Hanging underneath the bridge are folded steel stairs that mark the connecting paths to the buildings. A lighting concept with interactive elements sets the stage for the dynamic, filigree architecture of this bridge.

The tower, located at 1 Roebling Way - a street renamed by city officials to better fit the building - echoes the colors of the Suspension Bridge.  Built in earth tones, its windows reflect the sky and river images.

The ascending height of the building mimics the suspension cables of the nearby Roebling’s Bridge, a central feature of Covington’s waterfront. It also links the low horizon of residential structures to the east with the more modern commercial buildings to the west.

Through the vertical, non-repeating articulation of the facade, the building breaks from the conventional, horizontal orientation of typical high-rise buildings. Its multiple layers blur the distinction between interior and exterior, both visually and experientially. The resulting texture also provides shade to all units from the eastern sun.

In the words of Daniel Libeskind, "History is not over. This building, while modern in design, is based on shapes that reflect the history, traditions and landscape of Greater Cincinnati, yet calls to mind the possibilities that lay ahead. The Ascent is less a structure than a living, breathing piece of art that stirs the soul and lifts the spirit. The Ascent will provide a lifestyle unlike any other in Ohio, Kentucky, or Indiana. It is a building that will inspire a region. It is a call to greatness."

Built in earth tones, its windows reflect the sky and river images.The ascending height of the building mimics the suspension cables of the nearby Roebling’s Bridge, a central feature of Covington’s waterfront. It also links the low horizon of residential structures to the east with the more modern commercial buildings to the west.

Boston’s TREEPODS INIATIVE proposes to embody, and artificially enhance, the most important biological characteristic of natural trees: the capacity to clean the air, taking the CO² and releasing O².Boston’s TREEPODS INIATIVE is a sustainable project leaded by Influx_Studio and ShiftBoston. The aim ff this collaboration is to allow the achievement of Boston’s global goals in terms of carbon reduction programs in the short time, giving us enough time to make the change from the present fossil fuel economy into a new Zero carbon energy economy. Boston’s TREEPODS INIATIVE is a sustainable project leaded by Influx_Studio and ShiftBoston. The aim ff this collaboration is to allow the achievement of Boston’s global goals in terms of carbon reduction programs in the short time, giving us enough time to make the change from the present fossil fuel economy into a new Zero carbon energy economy.The proposal could be define as a CO2-scrubbing living machine. Treepods may well redesign in an urban radical new way our polluted urban environment, interacting with natural trees, and enhancing its carbon absorption capacity. In that way, those artificial trees don’t replace the natural ones, but they act like small urban “air cleaning infrastructures”. Advanced technologies are actually already developed that allow the capture of the atmospheric carbon dioxide from ambient air in an efficient, economic and sustainable way. Developed by Dr Klaus Lackner, Director of the Lenfest Center for Sustainable Energy at Columbia University, this revolutionary process is based on the discovery of the ‘humidity swing,’ a technology that enables the energy-efficient capture of CO2 from air, allowing to close the carbon cycle and creating a valuable product for beneficial use.

Looking at nature we can learn from one of the most unique trees in the world, the Dragon Blood Tree (Dracaena cinnabari). Its branches at maturity produce an umbrella shaped crown optimizing its form to create a canopy that provides a maximum of shading surface. The way that its canopy allows the wind flow is showing us an intelligent form like design. The TREEPOD will ne inspired by that, as well as by its branching structure in terms of storage and distribution of resources from ground to the canopy.

The canopy branching structure ends with a myriad of bulbs. They multiplies the contact points between air and the CO², serving as a filter. Working like as alveoli in a human lung, here is where the cleaning gaseous exchange takes place: an alkaline and environmentally friendly resin that reacts with air holding CO². When the CO² saturated resin reacts with water it release CO² for storage, and then it could be used again in the same process.

We propose to use the PET (Polyethylene terephthalate). It is the material commonly used for drink bottles. It presents several relevant advantages: it’s available in large quantities as recycled raw material, it can assume different colorations and degrees of transparency, it can be easily processed to obtain complex forms, it has good tensile resistance and mechanical properties. The entire TREEPOD structure is composed by modular elements, assembled as shown in the scheme. The tree will be made with a recycled and recyclable plastic.

Based in its modular capacity, issued from a honeycomb hexagonal geometry, the prototype is able to reach tree different levels of assemblage and urban function: The basic isolated unit as urban furniture. Three assembled units forming a hexagon define the TREEPOD, with social functions that a natural tree had. And finally, a group of trees, creating a great urban canopy, defining places to be.

It could be an interactive interface, allowing people to interact with the tree and each other. People could play and learn about the ecological paradigm shift. At its basis the tree will host a playing device: a seesaw that harvests kinetic energy. It will allow people to be involved, displaying information in “augmented reality” about de-carbonization process, about sustainable behaviors etc, proposing depending the urban and social context, different ways to help people collaborate each other and to engage citizens in the green agenda.

For this week the Architecture City Guide series headed to the city of Austin, Texas. Already our third stop in the Lone State, it is easy to see why Texans take such pride in their state, even when the Cowboys go 6 and 10. Both the capital of Texas and Live Music, Austin is a vibrant city that takes pride in being far from ordinary. Austin also plays host to South By Southwest (SXSW) which is being held this week, March 11th – 20th. Its eclectic and liberal lifestyle have led many Austinites to adopt the slogan “Keep Austin Weird.” In this context its architecture is as diverse as its people. This short exposé of a few contemporary and modern buildings hardly tells the story of Austin, so we ask you, the readers, to add to the list. Please share your favorites with us in the comment section below.For this week the Architecture City Guide series headed to the city of Austin, Texas.

Text description provided by the architects. Home to one of the most influential architects of the 20th Century, the Gropius House was the residence of Walter Gropius and his family during his tenure at Harvard University during the mid 1900s. Completed in 1938, the Gropius House was the first commissioned project in the United States for the famed architect. Located in Lincoln, Massachusetts the house is a hybrid of traditional New England aesthetic and the modernist teachings of the Bauhaus.

Located approximately one hour outside of Boston, Massachusetts and Harvard’s campus, Gropius selected a site in the town of Lincoln to accommodate the interests of his daughter’s education. The site for the house is set adjacent to the main road that cuts through the town, which is sits among fields, forests of trees, and farmhouses. In Gropius’ mind keeping with the vernacular of the surround New England farmhouse aesthetic was of primary concern, while also introducing modern, mass-produced, pre-fabricated elements into the design as well.

Situated amidst war and the spread of the modern architectural movement to the United States, the Gropius House is a fairly modest building that maintains the scale and materially identity with the surrounding area.  The facade of the house combines common brick and local clapboard with manufactured ribbons windows and glass block evoking a sense of stability and balance between old and new, traditional and modern, New England and European.

Yet while maintaining a connection with tradition, Gropius imposes the modernist aesthetic on the local materials by painting the house a stark white that when combined with the tinted ribbon windows and the glass block appears to be a, slightly Corbusian, foreign object placed in the landscape.

In regards to the interior of the house, Gropius did not take the New England architectural vernacular into consideration, rather the interior is a mix of fabricated pieces from the Bauhaus and furniture by Marcel Breuer.  Similar to the work that was happening simultaneously in Europe; the house employs an open spatial organization that filters light throughout the house through the large windows.

Similar to the exterior of the house, Gropius uses a minimalist color palette throughout the interior consisting of black, white, pale greys, and earth tones with only faint splashes of red found throughout the house.

At the time of completion, the Gropius House had created a stir among the architectural community, as well as most of the New England area, since the house was the first sign of what was considered the International Style appearing in America’s residential milieu. An assessment that Gropius found unnerving:

“As to my practice, when I built my first house in the U.S.A. - which was my own - I made it a point to absorb into my own conception those features of the New England architectural tradition that I found still alive and adequate. This fusion of the regional spirit with a contemporary approach to design produced a house that I would never have built in Europe with its entirely different climatic, technical and psychological background.”

The Gropius House was home to Walter Gropius and his family until his death in 1969, which was then officially transferred back to the owner of the land whom was so enthralled by Gropius and his work opened up her land to other architects to create similar establishments as Gropius.  In 2000, the house became a National Landmark, which is a testament to the influence of Walter Gropius’ life work.

Text description provided by the architects. The Silvertree residence is a study in how a small, dated, closed in and inwardly focused residence can be revived into an inspiring modern space that interacts with the outdoors.  The wonderful climate of the Sonoran desert, and the opportunity for indoor-outdoor living, was ignored in the previous floor plan of this vaguely Mediterranean 1970s home. A nicely scaled rear terrace with great desert, mountain and partial city views was nearly inaccessible in the floor plan of the existing house. The user had to either go through the existing garage or through the master bedroom to access the rear patio. A new multi-functional space, and a remodeled kitchen and dining room, all revolve around a new three-sided fireplace.

The fireplace is at the nucleus of the space and acts as a focal point while separating the spaces. The fireplace is positioned to open to all of the living spaces as well as the exterior patio. These new spaces allow the rest of the existing house to be connected with the exterior. The garage was relocated, creating better access in and out of the garage and allowing the rest of the rear of the house to open to the exterior. The new location buffers the living spaces from the roadway.  The garage is covered with integral color plaster contrasting but complementing the existing painted stucco house and site walls.  Storage is concealed behind birch panels allowing the garage to be minimal and uncluttered. The new garage acts as a showplace for the owners beloved restored 1970 Citroen DS. A pantry was added between living areas and the new garage creating a transitional space and extra storage for the new kitchen. The pantry is clad in birch panels with concealed pullout pantry doors.

Large retractable screens concealed in the ceiling provide privacy and solar control when needed.  The existing patio porch framing was saved and covered with birch panel plywood to unite the interior and exterior.

Integral color concrete floors below, and birch soffits above, extend to the exterior breaking the conventional opaque boundary, blurring the line between interior and exterior. A large custom sliding door can be opened to strengthen the connectivity with the exterior spaces.  The space now becomes an observatory in which one can experience the ever changing environment of the desert; the daily and annual changes of light; the blooming Palo Verdes in spring; and the spectacular lightning shows during the monsoons.

Text description provided by the architects. Located in the suburbs of Sendai, the site for this project was in the vicinity of two existing residential buildings designed by other architects. This house was therefore designed by taking into consideration how it would blend harmoniously into the surrounding area.

The facade of the building was covered in concrete in order to provide the inhabitants with a sense of privacy, as well as to ensure that signs of life within the house were not visible from the outside. The outer walls of the building made of reinforced concrete, externally insulated due to the cold northern climate, were also coated with a photocatalyst that gave them a white gleam. Another distinctive feature of the house was the sleek and lightweight impression created by the sharp profile of the eaves and small, sleeve-like walls detached from the building proper - both designed in order to soften the heaviness of the reinforced concrete.

A central courtyard sits in front of the entrance to the house on the first floor, while another courtyard that adjoins the south side of the family room also connects to the outdoor deck, establishing a sense of continuity with the raised tatami-floored space. The use of unfinished concrete for the interior walls and ceilings gives the impression of a gleaming, black hardness in relation to the white facade, creating a contrast between the interior and exterior of the house.

The client, a professional weaver, and her husband are preparing to move to San Juan Island once the husband retires. Their request was for studio space in which she could have all her weaving tools in one facility: her looms, her dying facilities, the sewing and assembly area and an office. She would use this space for her craft but also to hold weaving guild meetings and display her work.

In addition to the programmatic requirements of the studio they wanted to have an overflow bedroom for guests.

The solution is a generous main studio space flowing with natural light that provides ample display space while maintaining incremental views of the sound. Off of this space the auxiliary spaces have been defined by the folding back of the exterior shell: to one end a bath and office, to the other a “wet room”. The wet room could be closed off and opened to the exterior in order to allow fumes from dying and drying to not permeate the rest of the studio.

Two additional spaces, the sewing room and a guest bedroom appear as an extrusion of the main studio space set into the hill at the back of the studio. A series of sliding panels intended as display panels for weaving projects hide or reveal access to the back rooms and storage cabinets.

The site which is located on the southern slope of Lion’s head, within the trendy suburb, Tamboerskloof, commands spectacular views over Cape Town and the harbor. From the street one gets a hint of the building, but your first real interaction is with the timber box, which houses the guest suite, looming over as you draw near the premises. The gate leads one to a lush courtyard where granite stepping stones set in an indigenous garden guide you to the front door.

Upon entering the house you are confronted by a double volume timber screen anchored in a bed of marble. Shadows streak down the wall behind as the screen filters the light cascading in through a skylight located over the stairwell. The off-shutter finish of the concrete soffit is complemented by recycled timber parquet flooring laid in a herring-bone fashion. The brief required an arrangement of interconnectedness and it is from the entrance foyer that you can best appreciate how the spaces have been assembled in order to achieve this. The space serves as a circulation hub and access point to all the zones – the public component comprised of the living dining kitchen functions is located to your left with the garage entrance to your right. The staircase leading upstairs where the private living quarters are located, wraps around the timber screen becoming a walkway accessing the 2nd bedroom and guest suite and then a ramp as it leads you to the master suite.

The living dining component, located on the ground floor, is both versatile and durable with concrete, timber and marble dominating the palette. These materials have a reputation for maturing gracefully while the soft muted tones create a versatile canvas for interior styling. The dining space, backed by an open-plan kitchen, is set up for comfortable, generous gatherings and flows onto the outside entertainment area. The adjacent internal living space is designed more towards wintertime living. The space is cozy and introspective with the wood-burning fireplace drawing the viewer’s attention away from the views. The parquet flooring here is arranged in stretcher-bond fashion, a more contemporary adaptation of the norm.

The outside living space is flanked by the swimming pool. The predominantly summer space also lends itself to those cooler evenings thanks to the introduction of an outside fireplace. The off-shutter concrete slab which covers the space is suspended between the three massive timber-clad portals. Inserted into the slab is a walk-on skylight allowing additional sunlight to penetrate the space below. The deck structure and the main residence were envisaged as separate forms and to enhance this concept the joints between these two components are also glazed. The dialogue between the expansive and the intimate is particularly present within the upper, private living spaces. The guest suite and 2nd bedroom which is located on the opposite side of the entrance foyer represent contrasting approaches to space. The guest suite located on the street elevation opens up to views of signal hill, extending the space into the landscape while the 2nd bedroom despite having an identical configuration is intimate and contained, living out to its own secret courtyard framed by verdant planters and a timber pergola which serves as sun control as well as a security measure.

Located over the living-dining area the master suite has an open plan arrangement. The bed nestles up to a plinth clad in marble and walnut veneer while the bath floats on a slightly elevated bed of marble. Massive sliding doors and windows bring the views into the bedroom. The soffit level inside which was restrained due to height restrictions also assists in containing the expansive space. Bookshelves and books support this homely sense of scale.  The suite lives out to a deck on the NW elevation. Each of the sliding doors and shutters sit on separate racks meaning that they slide independently and can be stacked in all different possible configurations. The master suite also has a private outside shower court to the South-West from where the views of Table Mountain can be enjoyed.

The openings on the North-East and South-East are large to exploit the majestic views. To regulate heat ingress on these facades movable timber shutters which function as mechanisms for passive climate control were installed. The energy efficiency of the building achieved through the appropriate use of materials and techniques has ensured that no air-conditioning installation is required. The use of energy-efficient LED, fluorescent and low-voltage lighting throughout the house also cuts down on electricity usage significantly.

The solar installation at the Hofmeyr-Cohen Residence is responsible for all hot water intended for household use, under floor heating and the swimming pool. Solar collectors installed on the roof of the residence collect energy from the sun, which is then transferred to a water glycol mix. This energy (heat) is exchanged via internal heat exchangers to water which is stored in hot water storage cylinders. The flat plate glazed solar collectors which were used at the Hofmeyr-Cohen residence was chosen due to their high efficiency in the low operating temperature range, and is especially suitable for regions with high solar exposure and frost.

In a thermo siphoning system the heated water is transferred from the collector to the tank through convection. For this to work the storage tank needs to be installed higher than the solar collector otherwise natural convection cannot occur. At the Hofmeyr-Cohen residence it was necessary to consider the sightlines and views of neighbouring properties which meant that the tanks could not be accommodated on the roof where the collectors are. Instead the tank is located on the ground floor in a storage room behind the stairs, which means that a controller and pump was necessary to transfer the heated water to the tank. The pump and controller are both connected to the main power supply and have an average consumption of around (250-300 W/day).

For this to work the storage tank needs to be installed higher than the solar collector otherwise natural convection cannot occur. At the Hofmeyr-Cohen residence it was necessary to consider the sightlines and views of neighbouring properties which meant that the tanks could not be accommodated on the roof where the collectors are. Instead the tank is located on the ground floor in a storage room behind the stairs, which means that a controller and pump was necessary to transfer the heated water to the tank. The pump and controller are both connected to the main power supply and have an average consumption of around (250-300 W/day).

The building’s form evokes the images of offshore oil production. The prow-like shape recalling an oil tanker’s bow, and the tower mass elevated above the ground on piloti suggesting an offshore oil derrick. This effect is further heightened by the design of the ground plane which has been developed to suggest the ocean’s surface.

Internally, office and function spaces are organized around a central, full-height, sunlit atrium. Large sky-gardens carve away portions of the tower floor plates to allow daylight to penetrate into the atrium from all three sides. These sky-gardens take on different configurations on each of the sides in response to the sun angles encountered. Additionally, a skylight and clerestory windows at the top of the atrium allow filtered light to wash the atrium interior surfaces. A three-storey, L-shaped podium defines a courtyard and houses public spaces, such as meeting rooms, restaurants, and exhibition areas. The rotated triangular tower maximizes the use of the site and creates an entry courtyard along the quieter side which is entered through a symbolic gateway recalling traditional Chinese courtyards.

Text description provided by the architects. In a lively and modern city like Barcelona, architecture has an important role in maintaining standards of civility and quality. Moreover, the societal concern for maintaining a history and collective heritage, as well as caring for our environment, increasingly lead to the prolongation of life of our buildings, well above its materials.Therefore, continued care and maintenance of buildings during their use and further renewal or reform, are critical to maintain high levels of aesthetic quality, security and urban sustainability. Starting point As a major company headquarters in Barcelona, the new building should show a clear and consistent corporate image with its principles.

The project addressed the problem existing high-density zoning staff with unclear and undefined areas.  The architects provided a comprehensive approach to the organization, construction and design of all elements.  The strength of projecting a single gesture, the introduction of an abstract line, clearly defines a workspace and circulation space.  Agenda and organization  Since it was necessary to maintain the original structure and vertical communication cores, it was decided to restructure by dividing the spaces, one side featuring the vertical communication, and the other a spacediáfano. The organization of the workspace is further emphasized by two linear cabinets, which hide the servers.

Text description provided by the architects. Yoka Sara’s artistic flair is immediately apparent in the Kayu Aga House designed for Italian businessman Alberto Agazzi.  The reasoning behind the plan form of the house is initially elusive.  The compound essentially consists of a carport and three orthogonal sleeping pavilions located in the four corners of the site.  Occupying the center is a two-story pavilion containing the principal living/dining facilities, with an elevated studio at first floor and a verdant roof garden.  The central pavilion has a delightful oval staircase with bamboo balustrade rising from an elliptical pond.  Each of the sleeping pavilions has a private garden court with a terrace and an outdoor bathroom, and the routes to the center are differently choreographed.

There appears to be underlying rationale derived from a traditional Balinese compound, where family activities are assigned to different pavilions, but any resemblance to the traditional form is subverted by what at first sees a random arrangement of sinuous curved walls that serve to unify the various elements but simultaneously to separate the activities.

Yoka Sara’s conceptual sketches provide insight into the design process and clarify the purpose of the walls.  The site is divided into four layers from west to east, expressed as slightly radiuses line, the first layer being a physical barrier to the noise from the road that runs along the western boundary.  The barrier takes the form of a high wall and the service functions of the house tucked into the northeast corner of the site.  The second layer is the “west lawn” that distances the main pavilion at the center of the plan from the noise source.  The third layer is the linear structure of the central pavilion, with its elevated studio and roof garden, and the final layer, the “east lawn” between the central pavilion and the swimming pool.  Notes in the margin of the architect’s sketches dispel the notion that the layering is random for there is a distinct hierarchy of privacy and formal zoning of uses.

Overlaid upon the west-to-east layers are more pronounced and flowing transverse curves that are expressed as free-standing walls. The walls diverge to frame views to the east over paddy fields and acknowledge the rising sun at dawn of each new day.  These walls have pattern of gray and green vertical stripes that is repeated on the entrance gate. Finally, superimposed upon the system of lines is another system –one of movement.  A processional route leads from the arrival court, in the southwest corner, in a northerly direction beneath a pergola to a point immediately west of the central pavilion, where a sharp turn to the east directs attention to a patio between the living and the dining rooms, and thence to the east lawn.  Notes in the margins of the architect’s sketches describe this “journey” as a process of rejuvenation and discovery.  Natural light is an important consideration in the genesis of the form, and some views are temporarily withheld by bamboo screens to arouse curiosity.  The processional route extends to the 25-meter swimming pool with a gazebo, and beyond are tranquil views of rural life.  A light wind blowing off the paddy fields stirs chiming bells. The architectural language is totally modern and the design process is explained in terms of rational responses to site and climate, but ultimately the house is a visually delightful place with a myriad different moods and emotions. What more might one require of a home?

The functions are banal: a house divided in private area with bedrooms, and social area with living-rooms. The private areas are at street level under the plot, around a central courtyard with rooms opening to private patios in a intimate environment. The living rooms are around a void, that collects light from above and gazes the castle at the city centre.

The house is a recognizable archetype emptied of its centre by the light designed by a three heighted courtyard that opens horizontally at the garden level. The bedroom courtyards, revealed in the garden, relate with this archetypal object providing different readings on its scale. Scale and volume are controlled in a chaotic context, with a clear identity that from its core relates with the historical legacy far away: the Leiria Castle.

Text description provided by the architects. The existing building, was constructed in a problematic spot-on some very steep terrain and required an urgent renovation and expansion. The project was based on the construction of a clear and orderly hierarchical focused on the disposition of three pristine cube volumes and two prisms. The overwhelming volume of the original building, covered with corrugated sheet metal to regain its pure cubic form and align it with the other elements of the project.

The order is naturally established: on one side, contains the highest level of school classrooms, on the other pre-school classrooms, dining and sports facilities, and in between, with a clear gesture and energy, the backbone that links providing structure to the whole organism. The lines are clear and precise, and the organization uses as well. Everything has its right place, following an order and hierarchy. The clear structure of space contributes to the formation of the students giving them the serenity, order and clarity necessary for entry into the complex world of modern society with a strong and resilient individual basis. The microcosm of the school is a paradigm of society.

The more pragmatic aspects of architecture have not been forgotten, but are subordinate to the primary purpose to enhance it and give it more features. The visual connection between indoor and outdoor spaces has intensified under the premise that both are spaces on the learning and, therefore, can not and should be segregated. The benefits of good guidance and ventilation of the intermediate spaces and gardens, as well as the preference and attractiveness of the views were considered in the design of all elements.

The oblong body of the extension was implemented parallel to the street following a strict logic in order to: provide natural light to the pre-school classrooms, creating a secondary access that avoids the traffic courts and protect the inland areas of recreational.

The strong topographic elevation took advantage having a volume of two half-buried plants easily accessed from the car park by a footbridge leading to the deck. On the south side, a natural slope separates the building from the street and rear gardens created for top level classes. On the north side, playgrounds and recreation areas are in contact with the lower level, which houses the dining room, locker rooms and gym, with the respective storage rooms, facilities and setting. The building has a concrete pergola on deck, ready for future expansion of the classroom.

Text description provided by the architects. The University of Waterloo's Engineering Five building marks the first phase of a major expansion to the Faculty of Engineering and a dramatic new showcase for its innovative work.  The six storey structure consolidates previously dispersed departments with four stories of departmental labs, classrooms and offices above a two storey Student Design Centre (SDC). The SDC is conceived as a "daylight factory" where instructional space and design studios overlook high concrete framed work bays and shops supporting the fabrication and display of student projects.

Project Scope At 150,000 SF, Engineering 5 marks the first phase of a major expansion for Waterloo’s top ranked Engineering faculty. The project accommodates four floors of departmental labs, offices and classrooms above a two storey student design centre housing work bays, design studios, meeting rooms, student machine shops, engine test labs and a large computer commons. The design anticipates a major addition in 2013.Inspiration The design for Engineering five presents a highly abstract composition where patterns of pedestrian movement and the principal public spaces are read in contrast to the seamless graphic illusion created by an innovative ceramic frit application. The Central Atrium and the stair within it are designed to encourage movement between floors and the interaction of the various departments. Clad in a perforated acoustic metal panel and ribbed with fissures of LED light, the stair simultaneously performs circulation, lighting and acoustic duties within the six storey space. The building’s lower two floors are dominated by the student design centre – a suite of robustly structured, flexible spaces that offer infinite creative potential to student teams. Conditions of extreme transparency and overlook make the SDC the showcase of the building.

Context The University of Waterloo was substantially developed in the 1960s as a bucolic garden campus. Successive infill has clouded the original vision and until recently, the Engineering Faculty occupied a warren of congested spaces, at odds with the Faculty’s innovative programs. ENG 5 and its planned expansion mark the first realization of a strategic master-plan that commands a parcel of land to the east of the Campus ring road. Through its facade, its planning and its siting, ENG 5 defines a new era of expansion while uniting it with the existing campus.into a coherent public realm. ENG V and the space it shapes simultaneously define a new era of expansion and unite it to the existing campus.Sustainability Although, the client elected not to pursue LEED certification, the building is designed to achieve a high degree of sustainability.
