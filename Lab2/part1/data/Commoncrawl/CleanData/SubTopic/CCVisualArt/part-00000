2001’s mummy return cant entirely fault brendan fraser led franchise ambition often eclipsed budgetthe scorpion king looked place film unnatural facial movement overall appearance end however bad johnson look like animated doll actual person scorpion king give u creep it’s amazing gave spinoff movie suppose that’s johnson’s charisma coming full force apology bad cgiwhile don’t understand avatar getting franchise expansion tenyears debut film definitely can’t fault james cameron cgi effect earliest example come one greatest sequel time terminator 2 judgement day older cgi rarely look

surprise film nabbed oscar best visual effect art direction also get another award cgi that’s aged super wellang lee ha done amazing thing cgi vfx year crouching tiger hidden dragon life pi two example it’s honestly bit baffling thing got fumbled 2003’s hulk lee wanted bring genuine comic book feel movie suffered meandering story bad cgi many thing suffered movie like bizarrely nightmareish gamma dog whatever wa going nick nolte’s character one suffered quite much hulkthe hulk kind look like badly animated jolly green giant know like giant found packaging frozen vegetable wa toobright green skin color awkward proportion movement fact looked like puppet rampaging green rage monster please take pick made character go ‘smash’ page ‘flat’ screenwhile 2003’s hulk wa bad 2008’s wa mediocre best much like respective movie character finally wa done well 2012’s avenger subsequent film marvel cinematic universe using motion capture mark ruffalo hulk’s facial expression performance appear real genuine adding advance cgi technology hulk actually look like person wrinkle chest hair resemblance actor allows thing make sensegiven extended time hulk thor ragnarok show marvel studio

nothing joke cgi look amazing film especially get light reflect metal skin scuff mark explosion look absolutely amazingconsidering relatively small budget first deadpool movie received it’s amazing got colossus looking awesome stefan kapičić wa totally transformed best way ryan reynolds isn’t sure we’ll get third film we’re hoping colossus make returnwith hologram nonliving celebrity becoming thing make sense would something similar actor passed rogue one take place right event star war episode iv new hope naturally also used character use time filming episode iv however issue came needed use tarkin peter cushing originally played tarkin passed 1994while reflection window looked promising turned around dream dashed oddly terrifying feature using guy henry standin crew rogue one tried use technology bring cushing back result was… well bit frightening honest tarkin looked plasticky weirdly shiny comparison actor left vague sense unease made look unrealnow thanos proportional genocidal manic right oddly symmetrical square chin one thing admit even though wa responsible ripping heart use cgi josh brolin wa amazing totally transformed character came straight comic book page thing recognizable brolin wa voice coming thanos’ moutheven next character use traditional makeup zoe saldana’s gamora karen gillian’s nebula audience couldn’t even tell difference looked much part environment avenger infinity war definitely pinnacle done cgi film nowadaysin term modern cgi fails justice league probably top list big way biggest reason ciarán hind steppenwolf it’s hard tell personal trouble director zack snyder joss whedon stepping messed vfx process movie something shuffle around last minute wa done steppenwolf he’s supposed bean emissary darkseid first look world new god also doesn’t look finished like final bos early 10 videogamesteppenwolf another grey hulking villain mediocre cgi either way audience expecting something truly epic wa first time justice league together onscreen look amazing failed ultimately hope cgi sin steppenwolf dont follow ava duvernay take new godseven back 2002 dobby house elf wa probably precursor amazing vfx work done since fact lot today probably traced back harry potter franchise develop lot technology truly bring wizarding world life since one ha quite stolen heart like dobby even though role film wa drastically reduced comparison book audience believed wa screenhe looked character interacted interacted cgi work wa believable audience went along even end cried dobbybefore dobby turned game upside term cgi harry potter sorcerer’s stone cgi people wa laughably bad back especially flying scene matthew lewis daniel radcliffe suffered worst neville longbottom went wild ride broom cgi lewis looked bad 2001 standard made look like unfinished puppet especially neville hit groundsadly individual working film couldnt use wizardry make cgi better quidditch scene cut back forth real people cgi puppet heightened feeling uncanny valley scorpion king 2001 wa amazing year cgi moviesthe dark knight remains one pinnacle superhero film achieve stellar performance moody atmosphere excellent direction batman film achieves unprecedented level perfection one best part film cgi used achieve halfburned look aaron eckhart’s harvey dentnolan described process “when looked le extreme version real

imagesas technology change studio using turn back clock older actor past needed older actor look younger hired younger actor looked older one however advance technology many studio using cgi turn back clock tends fail work one sadder example tron legacydespite best effort younger looking jeff bridge made audience uncomfortable highly stylized highly cgi movie film wanted bring back bridges’

actually masterclass cgi usage amazing shrinking set piece dizzying dive quantum realm director peyton reed definitely knew bring fun hero’s power one technically proficient moment however wa use cgi make michael douglas younger 1989 scenesunlike extended time bridge wa given tron antman smartly made sure keep scene short sweet gave charged rewinding clock time order make sure looked pretty perfect final product douglas’ performance centerstage believability cgi hopefully age reversal get better here2011’s green lantern wa supposed harken dc cinematic universe horrible review poor audience reception quickly put kibosh plan story wa bit confusing frustrating larger part criticism came cgi film parallax sinestro character film looked bit fake interacting reynolds especially expanded time wa training corpsthe worst worst however remains reynold’s superhero suit rather making realistic suit opted entirely cgi suit making look like reynolds’ muscle exposed green wa completely mocked audience fan alike even reynolds take potshot especially 2016’s deadpool let’s leave superhero suit realistic leastfor part lord ring hobbit example totally transform actor using cgi recent though possibly unnecessary trilogy come benedict cumberbatch smaug using mocap filming soundstage filmmaker able beautifully transform cumberbatch dragon fact audience definitely see cumberbatch’s face smaug’s design add another level detail productionthe end result leaf audience truly mesmerizing virtually realistic dragon interacts environment also amp danger audience see bilbo martin freeman others near smaug it’s surprise character award visual effect societyfantastic four fant4stic one superhero movie bad people talk bad ‘so bad it’s good’ kind way michael chiklis didn’t look much better ben grimmthe thing 2005 film jamie bell fared far worse didn’t look complete much like everything else feel like time done reshoots digitally adding actor would better spent making

2 alternate dimensional superman still superman notjon hamm popular choice among fan superman batman likeable talented ha dark hair strong jawline superheroes tend require however right superman saying couldnt pull — maybe time draper mad men — cool intense aesthetic seems suited bruce wayne chivalrous man steel good thing news ben affleck leaving batman role seems everpresent hamm ha confirmed interest taking overhamm superman thanks hamm batman yes pleaseanother popular choice among fan armie hammer wa nearly batman cancelled george miller film justice league mortal wa reportedly running superman man steel henry cavill wa obviously final choice give hammer shot ha good look talented actor already least two different superhero role hasnt part major blockbuster franchise perhaps thats waiting right superhero role come way maybe timetatums name ha mix plenty superman fancasting list sure sure handsome funny role never line superman persona hard separate tatum comedic role film like 21 jump street logan lucky even difficult picture superman lovable goof isnt say play goofy role tatum charismatic channeling brand humorbesides probably busy chained gambit film may may actually existhes probably first person come mind james marsden would make fantastic superman best known playing cyclops xmen film great work westworld teddy flood ha build talent would perfectly suit red blue boy scout marsden would make recognizable choice recognizable would take viewer movie besides got dashing allamerican look enough charisma go around — need proof latter see enchanted charlie hunnam hasnt struck gold blockbuster movie role seems fit superman mold handsome fit ha tough exterior come superhero however tends come bit edgy grizzled role someone clean idealistic superman possible someone seem tough play superman charlie hunnam might fall category maybe weve watching much son anarchy might better suited someone like green arrow — look like character without even tryingif warner bros want new superhero franchise cavills exit better start young liam hemsworth brother thor chris hemsworth would make interesting choice superman dark hair handsome built — check superman physical box youth pro con might take time audience take seriously fullyformed superman age also give franchise film time gestate without worry actor getting old probably wont many fan first choice might worth considerationlike charlie hunnam tom hardy way roughandtumble play superman definitely popular pick hardy love character odd eccentric — quite uplifting superman persona fan would used role venom evidence movie isnt even yet dont get u wrong great actor suited someone straightforward tom hardy edge iconic shoehorning superman costume may stifle venom fails end market new superhero role would make stellar wolverinehe might one obscure choice list sam witwer would make great superman would know star war universe mainly starkiller force unleashed game also played role smaller property like upon time battlestar galactica coincidentally smallville like henry cavill time casting superman sam witwer relatively unknown actor wouldnt bring much baggage role star war fan might need minute thing click place got look charisma take big role like supermanhis disney day zac efron ha proven quite hot commodity hollywood might sound like good choice first — young fit still heartthrob used — still way babyfaced believable superman even warner bros go younger new superman entire generation still see efron troy high school musical also charming hopeful stoic like superman — would make great dick grayson though even younger hal jordan green lantern reboot ever come fruitionnot critically acclaimed actor dense filmography belt matt bomer ha actually played superman wa voice kalel animated film superman unbound voice certainly good fit look part well famous enough appearance jarring unknown enough fan unsure casting ha proven track record would make solid choice especially great hair like give superman iconic strand loose hair would need costumechris evans perfect role got look build attitude would make great superman rather would make great superman wasnt immediately recognizable steve rogers captain america film evans ha proven supermantype main work cap unfortunately way hard people unsee starspangled costume would also cause uproar marvel dc fan community much evans probably wouldnt even want glance social medium perfect would shouldnt supermanthis one might bit outsidethebox justin theroux would make interesting choice typical muscledout superhero type though certainly inshape also older choice though old would unfit role either ha different kind energy prototypical superman one thats difficult describe way difficult describe nicholas cage wa cast superman seeing actually happen though maybe justin therouxled older superman story franchise need clean slateadam driver name ha tossed around casting among fan seems like wrong way go doesnt really look tends bring darker melancholy energy role might work superman young also way recognizable role kylo ren star war franchise definitely talented enough bring something interesting man steel nowadays might bit highprofile job similar word spoken nicholas cage cancelled superman liveswes bentley best known role american horror story hunger game american beauty —but could work superman definitely ha edginess choice dont also little smaller side comparison someone like henry cavill said certainly pull cleancut superman look might need bulk bit bentley make list runnerup fan probably didnt think consider obscure pick folkshes talented popular somehow apart major blockbuster franchise yet wa cast spiderman far home month ago jake gyllenhaals name still running dc superheroes — namely batman said many fan believe clark kent could compelling sure gyllenhaal might look part ha played seriously dark role jarhead donnie darko prisoner nightcrawler — guy isnt exactly known embodying hope role chooses hed much better suited young batman superman muchcan picture ben barnes sporting cape probably know villainous role — portrays logan delos westworld billy russo marvel punisher —but said guy ha charming look might work blue boy scout might need bulk role shake reputation smarmy antagonist already ha handsome look youd expect superman might need practice stoic face putting suit barnes isnt stereotypical superman certainly viable choicegame throne fan probably know going fit talented like everyone else list extremely handsome entirely difficult people separate supermanand one westeros despicable personality comment flood jamie lannister ha softened year keep mind going role superman one heroic figure popular culture dont deny ha talent one bit stretchcould bucky barnes next supes sebastian stan hit mainstream popularity role winter soldier done plenty great work outside marvel cinematic universe gossip girl upon time martian tonya — plenty talented ha look could provide certain sensitivity choice dont usually bring role recognizable face attached role say captain america costar sebastian stan superman ideamichael fassbender extraordinarily talented name frequently found running sort role highprofile movie franchise said probably wrong choice superman definitely ha proper strong feature older recognizable side mention brings intensity role captivating doesnt work last son krypton anything casting superman waste intensity character doesnt require said could play number role dc universe would better suit edge braniac ra al ghul sinestro — supermanhow upandcoming choice jesse williams known role grey anatomy well character video game detroit become human seems like would great alternative alisters perhaps recognizable superman replacement ha right build good look sweeter sensitive side comparison brawny choice list would new face blockbuster movie scene like many past superman could role take career new level — along revitalizing character potentially new franchisewe cant deny look part good hair athletic build strong jawline — model said look arent everything jamie dornan doesnt seem like blue boy scout type perhaps work fifty shade grey franchise still fresh mind bit intense iconic hero maybe little sultry reason superman cant sultry necessarily vibe dont work guy youd expect save cat tree right ballpark quite supermananother candidate younger kalel richard madden could fit part really well talented actor got dashing look play prince cinderella fan game throne know act role upstanding leader day week younger side youthful look edge come building longstanding franchise maybe hard tell scruff could really pull young clark kent need shave — could opt superman tradition replace facial hair cgi mouth either way hed great supermanfor dont remember brandon routh ha already played superman way back 2006s superman return wasnt bad either unfortunately probably best didnt return role couldnt swing basically still splitting image young christopher reeve dc fan already closely associate work arrowverse television show would also confuse older audience see one guy one superman movie come back replace cavills superman soon even year unless want case doubt would many complaintslet u pitch idea lowprofile actor famous certain generation specifically playing superman return role big screen decade latertom welling could easily return adventure older superman perhaps end career fathering young jonathan kent aka superboy bit specific think like brandon routh chance however tom welling hasnt major star since time

belief saturn couldnt really handle 3d visuals well interesting theory since one launch game panzer dragoon wa 3d dynamo game stellar first sequel played amazingly showcased one gaming unique original world fact interesting universe almost seemed somewhat wasted used onrails shooting game sega decided third installment panzer dragoon saga epic 3d rpg featured flightbased combat first two game wrapped within one best roleplaying game timeunfortunately saga wasnt released saturn already begun commercial nosedive game never really chance get audience deserved next far final panzer dragoon game xbox wa great disappointingly returned nonrpg standard shooter style first two installment hd remake saga always top gamers wish list u would happy enough get new true saga follow would even betterthere nothing wrong fond childhood memory game actually awful problem reach adulthood arent willing admit bad game used love arent actually goodthe first step admitting problem second step admitting altered beast always ha terrible game slow clunky boring short even late80s arcade game worst redeeming feature game mantobeast transformation really cool first time see already reusing beast form different color even though game 20 minute long inexcusablethere wa 2005 reboot attempt playstation 2 wa released europe japan never came north america due lack interestand importantly

wa still solid fighter unique timespanning setup diverse cast character sega cd followup challenge darkside upped ante gory elaborate finishing move put mortal kombat shame third game wa reportedly work saturn axed system popularity began decline would last world saw ec serieswhile bad ec doesnt appear many sega retro compilation probably best franchise stay past fighting game genre isnt prolific wa cant sustain nearly many separate franchise new ec game would likely get overlooked plus fantastical character probably wouldnt translate best modern makeover anyhowsure street rage bite much final fight capcom probably shouldve sued sega considering street rage 2 best beatemup time almost irrelevant drew inspiration beatemups rocky transition 3d day gotten right hard see sega ha reluctant revive acclaimed serieslike vectorman 3d reboot wa planned one point wa eventually cancelled perhaps sega saw poorly game like final fight streetwise fared decided wa better bother ironically though sega actually one company doe know 3d beatemups right people behind incredibly fun dynamite deka series north american gamers know series better die hard arcade dynamite coptheyve already got solid foundation work bringing sor 3d could also go double dragon neon route retromodern 2d game either way need new street rage alreadya lot potential sega reboots classic franchise never

spawn’s role superhero hierarchy ha always matter debate he’s member dc marvel family thus tends get lost modern medium shuffle focus film company still he’s managed enter mainstream conciseness thanks large part notoriety golden globewinning hbo animated series based character still even many know spawn really know specific exploit remain contained within page characters’ comic fan still written “to read” list somewhere towards bottom pagethose dove history spawn however first tell character world among intriguing comic creation even familiar character may surprised learn far spawn series meet eye history rise idea imagined todd mcfaralane leading comic icon littered fascinating factoid may never heard beforethese 15 thing never knew spawnclick button start article quick viewit’s difficult follow ongoing comic storyline best time you’ve got able keep strict release schedule ideally start reading arc beginning order avoid hunt relevant back issue even read spawn start tough time keeping character adventure though thanks early issue printed ordernobody entirely sure happened reason issue 19 20 spawn skipped initial release strangely issue rereleased 19 came 24 25 20 came 25 26 theory regarding happened popular one upstart image comic made sort technical error resulted missing publishing deadlinespawn’s power curious subject beginning al simmons’ transformation spawn granted certain ability come associate many superheroes super strength super speed ability rock pretty awesome cape power spawned – pun…you know it’s intended – necroplasm run bodythings started get little crazy ability spawn’s suit became pronounced instance wa established early spawn’s suit organic entity sometimes act independently spawn order keep thing check mcfarlane tried establish idea “power counter” spawn could exhaust using much magic character relied suit often early issue eventually though wa established spawn essentially limited imaginationas mentioned spawn incredibly powerful entity wields power granted necroplasm flow body power suit even able draw hatred evil world order replenish inner strength many power strength fuel one generally come handy ability quickly heal wound well almost woundsee spawn crossover event batman wa incident led batman throwing batarang spawn’s face spawn could healed wound rather easily instead chose take old shoestring use seal gap face well sometimes spawn doesn’t like show full extent power order retain degree humanity sported shoestring look quite issuescreators go many version idea ever dare call final product spawn wa different hell favorite soldier ha certainly evolved year ha also retained many trademark element people associate character he’s still got incredible cape he’s still caught matter involving heaven hell still deal justice demonically dark worldinterestingly wa time none trademark element part spawn character todd mcfarlane began working spawn wa teenager originally envisioned character scifi warrior mcfarlane ha released sketch early design show spawn sported pretty spiffy blue gray white suit feel like belongs outer space course eventually adopted hellish red black attire known foranyone remembers playing great soul calibur 2 around time initial release doubt remember console version game came exclusive character gamecube player instance got play legendary warrior link legend zelda playstation 2 player able take tekken’s heihachi mishima battle xbox gamers got play spawn spawn wa certainly cool addition fan always wondered microsoft chose nonvideo game character exclusiveas turn didn’t much choice microsoft didn’t want add master chief game meaning left iconic xbox character work tried work deal put one dead alive character game never able make happen happy eventually land spawn even soul calibur’s developer remove cape wa difficult implement gamewhen creating spawn todd mcfarlane ran interesting issue relates character’s race see mcfarlane felt still wasn’t enough interesting black superhero character world comic wanted design one would stand time didn’t want people solely focus fact character created wa black otherwise try turn character’s race unnecessary controversyas decided al simmons transformed spawn skin charred crisp mcfarlane’s word wa done effort remove pigmentation reader may unable get past wa certainly unique approach idea eventually lead pretty substantial milestone spawn film adaptation became first major superhero movie feature black lead characterspawn familyfriendly comic source material inherently dark various writer contributed character’s adventure year fondness pushing envelope whenever possible still spawn superhero doe fulfill certain merchandising requirement word matter dark spawn get someone somewhere expected still sell action figurestodd mcfarlane initially tried reach deal mattel regarding right produce action figure based spawn property two could never agree term mcfarlane created brand spawn action figure differed current superhero action figure market several way mcfarlane’s figure intricately detailed came elaborate packaging generally speaking designed collectible obvious quality difference spawn toy superhero toy soon forced manufacturer adopt mcfarlane’s style make industry standardas may know spawn ha many dealing underworld it’s kind thing operative hell spawn often required work demon even doe often try force good isn’t wellknown spawn’s dealing heaven specifically dealing god that’s really shame consider strange interesting said dealing usually arefor instance wa time spawn kinda sorta accidentally kidnapped god heshe sometimes change wa disguised old woman that’s little awkward wa time god came spawn disguised dog laid little heavenly law giving spawn ancient weapon weirdest interaction though occurred even higher power transformed god devil child al simmons’ wife new husband wa done teach humility humantodd mcfarlane interesting guy want generous call eccentric sometimes doe say thing seem little offkilter even inexplicable style seems source much creative brilliance sometimes manifest rather odd behaviorfor instance consider period late spawn’s run todd mcfarlane decided step away series hand writing duty guy named carlton getting write spawn wa quite coup carlton consider teh fact nobody ever even heard writer wa given assignment turn that’s carlton never existed started writing spawn reason todd mcfarlane decided write 20 issue spawn name carlton apparently thought would funit’s uncommon creator medium base creation people event real life almost everyone us experience basis creation degree case spawn though really hope story man becomes agent hell order repent previous sin save family doesn’t share many similarity anyone’s lifeat least far comic’s character name concerned though certainly doe every major character spawn got name person todd mcfarlane’s life al simmons instance wa named old roommate mcfarlane’s simmons’ wife daughter named mcfarlane’s wife daughter simmons’ friend terry fitzgerald wa named reallife longtime friend mcfarlane sure it’s creative way come name harm could possibly come itthe answer “what harm could possibly come taking name real people” also begin notsobrief lawsuit portion list spawn property ha subject numerous lawsuit year one absurd one ha time professional hockey player sued todd mcfarlane matter fictional mobstersee mcfarlane created rather despicable mobster name antonio twistelli early spawn’s run point mcfarlane admitted taken character’s name real life person time however person wasn’t someone close mcfarlane rather professional hockey player named tony twist mr twist didn’t much care association ended suing mcfarlane 15 million 2004 matter following series appeal mcfarlane ended pay twist 5 million settle lawsuitnot long debuted spawn became one hottest property comic fan everywhere really latched series’ incredibly dark tone compelling early storyline series wa popular fact mcfarlane wa able convince writer like alan moore frank miller neil gaiman contribute original storyline character’s universe part contribution resulted fascinating story gaiman’s contribution however ended resulting almost two decade legal headachessee gaiman’s story introduced three new character spawn universe quickly became fan favorite mcfarlane wa impressed character decided use subsequent issue problem wa promised gaiman writer could retain right creation gaiman balked continued usage mcfarlane decided create knockoff character instead still satisfied gaiman sued mcfarlane triggered lengthy lawsuit wa finally ruled gaiman’s favor interestingly gaiman later sold one character – angela – marvel might know thor’s sister regular guardian galaxy comicsat point you’re probably thinking “man todd mcfarlane would presumably whatever could avoid yet another spawnrelated lawsuit” you’d right actually mcfarlane’s desire avoid possible legal incident surrounding property might forced forever alter pretty crucial part character’s historywhen mcfarlane wa pitching idea spawn movie new line cinema someone studio noticed wa bit legal issue film followed character’s origin exactly comic al simmons wa killed character named chapel wa actually borrowed image comic series youngblood chapel wa going appear film someone would needed pay creator rob liefeld fee since nobody wanted cut extra check mcfarlane decided simply change identity simmons killer woman named jessica priest priest wa referenced simmon’s true killer many comic wellsome older reader might remember time mcdonalds got bit hot water deciding include toy based film batman return happy meal concerned citizen felt wa irresponsible company feature children’s toy based pg13 film mcdonalds claimed struck deal feature film mpaa gave movie final rating eventually whole thing died world moved ona year later taco bell oneupped promotion based rated r spawn movie taco bell wasn’t specifically marketing child nobody seemed outraged doesn’t mean promotion weren’t downright bizarre kind make sense taco bell would promote spicy food help soldier hell final promotion tonally strangethe spawn movie generally remembered misguided attempt translate character big screen remembered generally speaking nicest thing anyone say john leguizamo turned memorable performance violator it’s interesting think film would turned studio’s original choice director tim burton able commit project go alex proyas dropped movie order direct dark cityhowever there’s “what if” scenario interesting idea hiphop artist snoop dogg playing spawn wa almost case yes according snoop famous rapper wa approached star film actually read part already strange casting call becomes much bewildering consider highprofile actor like smith cuba gooding jr denzel washington also considered rolewhat fun factoid know todd macfarlanes greatest creation think star reboot sound comment section

stormtroopers often stealth army empireimperial force intended they’re supposed lethal efficient hoardlike militia strike fear soul character audience alike many character series afraid based reputation alone script tell mayhaps audience know betterwe know stormtroopers notorious bad shot we’ve watched perform wildly inconsistent fashion several battle we’ve watched obiwan alone manipulate dozen wa completely past prime definitely don’t scare u everchanging uniform expanding role functionality within star war canon still intrigue consistent provider series’ best — head scratching — moment here’s take 15 wtf thing beloved beleaguered stormtroopers ever doneclick button start article quick viewconsidering many different version stormtroopers exist day often fall would seem prudent first order train crop stormtroopers immune jedi mind trick obiwan manipulates several time new hope classic “these aren’t droids you’re looking for” line moment shuts tractor beam distracts several false noisesin force awakens rey fool daniel craig’s stormtrooper try getting release leave weapon behind wa first time intentionally using force mind kind vulnerability seems like fatal flaw point star war legendsverse ha trooper bazooka trooper withstand radiation even trooper wield lightsabers can’t get capable resisting pesky mind trick plus jabba hutt immune thing shouldn’t stormtrooper also abilitythe various army stormtroopers see original trilogy whether they’re cold weather assault trooper hoth scout trooper endor classic stormtroopers we’re used seeing pop cultureverse cannot seem hit target ever obiwan note early stormtroopers posse certain unique precision wise wa never actually see precision translated screentake legendary scene luke leia swinging safety inside death star new hope several shot fired good guy bad latter multiple seemingly straightforward opportunity kill rebel intruder casualty stormtroopers there’s entirety empire strike back can’t seem hit moving target sedentary target anything really performance cloud city jungle endor bad they’re worthy individual entry list stormtroopers least ot almost laughably inaccurate could changing timesother several dozen shot fired chirrut imwe blind hero literally walked warzone manually flip switch made rebels’ sacrifice worth stormtroopers rogue one much deadly precise ot baffling chronologically speaking trooper rogue one came misfired badly star warsthe introduction death trooper could something elongated mask jetblack metal frame ability actually hit target look like cyberdyne system’s latest batch terminator previous iteration stormtrooper we’ve ever seen introduced guarding rogue one’s primary villain director krennec brought certain sense menace dread haven’t associated stormtroopers long time together shore trooper actually formidable force rebel scarif beachfront we’re used seeing stormtroopers effective maybe it’s new trendthe first time meet stormtroopers star war they’re essentially blasting rebels’ front door displaying vast capability breaking room concerned see slaughtered dozen jawas poor old uncle owen aunt beru mission looking two droids mo eisley know primary mission find capture r2d2 c3p0 manage come across favorite droids trapped locked room fear worstinstead get bumbling incompetence stormtrooper literally tap door time buddy move right nothingmoretoseehere kind way there’s none breaking door business anymore apparently droids pop doorway right troopers’ hasty exit fan left facepalming instead reinforcing idea stormtroopers legitimate threat scene turn comic fodder probably wasn’t lucas co wanted timein “showdown smuggler’s moon” star wars’ marvel comic luke get captured grakkus searching yet another jedi temple trained fight fighting pit kreel elite combatant serf sergeant stormtroopers kreel incredible fighter dubbed “gamemaster” time grakkus wields lightsaber blaster know useunbeknownst luke kreel wa commissioned darth vader keep luke close ultimately turning sith lord luke eventually escape captivity might time get best kreel — it’s definitely commonplace see jedi get handled stormtrooper way luke end getting schooled kreel “next time try little harder die” kreel tell luke besting sparring match point stormtrooperstormtroopers weren’t around much empire infuriating incompetence particularly visited home lando calrissian supposed elite fighter yet form technique messier ever instead hiding behind wall incorporating cool battle plan even physically attempting dodge laser coming way stormtroopers simply stand one shooting back time allowing get picked one onethey also let leia lando get away wounded luke droids allowing calrissian men get jump lando’s smooth talker shouldn’t stormtroopers able counter cunning charm brief stint cloud city showed u stormtroopers don’t believe practicing effective battle tactic sure don’t believe thing like reconnaissance missionswe one scene fn2199 tr8r fan taken calling wa doozy tr8rs batononlightsaber fight finn wa definitely something never seen remains one awakens’ memorable momentsin greg rucka’s awakening anthology book learn tr8r finn trained first order together tr8r also nickname “nines” wa quite athlete soldier wa also kind pompous jerk book that’s another issueonscreen hooked second revealed baton produced quick confident manner knew something amazing wa happen called finn “traitor” proceeded adroitly outmaneuver lightsaber noob tr8r became unlikely breakout memegif generator film bad stormtrooper one scenethis flub remains fan favorite leia luke han chewie trapped trash compactor become imperial recycling c3p0 r2d2 locked control room trying help friend escape certain horrific death group 5 6 stormtroopers finally make way control room charging blaster ready capture droids they’re supposed look threatening course one bang helmet hard noticeably affect gait menace go right window army baddie becomes laughing stockgeorge lucas ha stated dvd commentary big fan accidental head clang noted jango fett bump head door slave honor original headbanging stormtrooper moment great laugh embarrassing stormtroopers everywherea great deal go wrong trooper endor scene particular need unpacking first moment han leia allied rebel gathered outside trying find way imperial outpost ewok go rogue run steal scout trooper’s speeder don’t thing lock instead one trooper telling others “i’ve got guy stay guard entrance” three four guarding door take one tiny ewok leaving one man alone get easily overtakenguarding door main outpost seems like important job trained soldier make mistake like isn’t one even match ewok han look entourage give one signature sly grin noting easy idiotic scout made mission point ot it’s simply stormtroopers assist enemy laxthey look like alien alien franchise wearing punisher mask claw three part freddy krueger two part wolverine learn wa darth vader thought surprising force unleashed ii video game hear see hear clang knife metal sinister hissing breath first see slithering oozing terrifying presence typically associated stormtroopers terror trooper also called imperial terror soldier certainly live namethey’re force unleashed ii book video game impact definitely felt they’re seen heard video game meet fett asks vader help mission vader offer terrifying killer “they’ll do” fett say sizing boba fett need assistance doesn’t mess aroundhere’s another scene endor need unpacking luke leia arrived planet presumably never ridden used speeder bike scout trooper presumably bit longer mastery primary vehicle yet somehow luke leia proceed take outmaneuver four highly trained military men mid air top speedluke jedi established pilot skill expected doesn’t mean scout trooper literal pushover siblings’ dalliance trooper wa minute wa yet another unrealistic moment establishing stormtroopers complete failure biggest eyeroll inducing moment come one scout actually outsmarts leia getting fall bike promptly turn around look instead watching he’s going crash speeder immediatelyif judge empire based behavior stormtroopers scene alone would never fear employ action ever darth vader would embarrassed ever seen kylo ren around back would mother lightsaber fitshan leia luke chewey run seven stormtroopers looking capture andor kill rebel one trooper yell “it’s blast them” han fire taking one seven response instead blasting back seeing still advantage number taking cover carrying mission way turn run away it’s great fun watching han charge right eventually running room full trooper intentional move trap rebel might worked might come across savvy stand remains yet another laughable failure stormtrooper resumewhen examining entirety poor performance endor troopers’ battle ewoks arguably make look worst sure ewoks outnumbered stormtroopers benefit home field advantage supposed army emperor baddest baddie galaxy felled easily benign waysseveral time ewoks zero difficulty sneaking trooper physically outmaneuvering making look plain silly one point ewoks basically hit time spear stab — hit crumble like cooky later troop highly trained imperial soldier get taken mediumsized boulder much oomph behind even forgiving fan face palming said done ewoks end playing bongo villain helmet stormtroopers galaxy far far aways punchline yet againthis wa wtf moment sheer enormity well devastating impact side survived great jedi purge became legendary execution order 66 — wa indeed execution — stormtroopers everywhere land midflight midtraining stopped began carrying new primary mission courtesy palpatine extermination remaining jediobiwan wa shot midflight twi’leks gunned swamp jedi across galaxy swarmed stormtroopers theyd working alongside previously attempt wa even made yoda’s life although obiwan managed survive course although jedi wa moment time wa shocking wa devastating wa rare moment stormtroopers actually carried order great success also helped allow palpatine establish temporary dominance reverberation still felt decade later force awakensthis wa huge disappointment instead resisting intruder way muchhyped leader stormtroopers give han finn exactly they’re asking maybe it’s we’re used seeing gwendoline christie brienne tarth steely strong fiercely loyal warrior play game throne finn get haughty demanding asking betray she’s loyal expected box ear something there’s zero brienne captain phasma witty retort snappy tough comeback doesn’t even try fight back overpower instead there’s just…complianceconsidering first meet phasma ha trouble okaying partaking mass slaughter innocent compliance enemy make seem weak best extremely cowardly worst shell back episode viii there’s room redemption stand ha one biggest wtf moment allwhat major stormtrooper wtf moment miss effective people give credit let u know comment
