Many television experts name the year 2000 as the official start of the “golden age of television” that we’re still experiencing today. It’s true: the decade of the ‘00s was chock-full of excellent television programming.Even with all of the fantastic shows on air today, many viewers still point to the series that came out of the ‘00s as the best-of-the-best, swearing that they can’t be topped.However, in order to understand just how good some of the programming that came out of the 2000s was, it’s also important to review how flat-out awful some of the ‘00s series were at the same time.This list will cover both shows that are considered to be the cream of the crop and the worst of the worst from the ‘00s. It includes shows of all genres, from comedies to highbrow dramas, and also includes shows from cable networks like NBC to premiums like HBO.As a result of television’s highly subjective nature, this list uses Rotten Tomatoes as a reference, a site that collects critics’ reviews and averages all of their ratings together to give a single score to each TV show.Some of the television series on the list received perfect scores of 100%, while others rank all the way down in the single digits.With that said, here are the 10 Best (And 5 Worst) ‘00s Shows According To Rotten Tomatoes.Click the button below to start this article in quick viewNBC’s comedy/spy thriller Chuck answers the question of what would happen if The Office met 24. Zachary Levi played main character Chuck Bartowski, an average guy who works a computer help desk.However, Chuck’s average lifestyle comes to a screeching halt and he’s soon pushed into the spy lifestyle after he reads an encrypted email with government secrets and they become implanted in his mind.NSA Major John Casey (played by Adam Baldwin) and CIA Agent Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) are tasked with protecting Chuck and the information he now possesses. Through the course of the series, the three work together on different spy cases.The unique concept and genre-blending style of Chuck won critics over immediately. The first season received a high rating of 87% on Rotten Tomatoes, and Chuck continued to gain equally high ratings as the series went on. Its fifth and final season even secured a perfect 100% rating.While the series wasn’t perfect in television critics’ eyes, they still stuck by it through all five seasons because it was one of the few genuinely entertaining and consistent series on air at the time.Critics praised the NBC series for its fresh humor, plot twists, and entertaining writing. They also loved Zach Levi’s performance, which was described as charming and endearing.Chuck won an overall rating of 90% on Rotten Tomatoes for all of these successful qualities.Lost was one of the most unique television viewing experiences to come out of the 2000s, and was one of the first shows of the decade to grab the attention of television audiences nationwide.Lost was also one of the first television shows ever that interacted with its audience through websites and related novels, helping the show gain a loyal – and even obsessive – fan base in the process.The series had one of the most original concepts to play on television. It followed a group of passengers that survived a plane crash and were stranded on a mysterious and scary island and must now work together to figure out what to do next.Viewers at home were fascinated by the series, and so were professional television critics. The series ran for six series, and its ratings on Rotten Tomatoes never dipped below 80%, which is an impressive record.Critics celebrated Lost’s character-driven plots, original sci-fi elements, and consistently strong plot lines and performances from the show’s actors.Thanks to all of the attention and praise it received from critics, Lost is still named as one of the best series to come out of the ‘00s and even one of the best television shows ever made.It’s not surprising, then, that Lost has a high overall rating of 91% on Rotten Tomatoes.A show has to be pretty bad in order to gain less than 25% of critics’ approval. However, a series like The Beautiful Life no doubt earns that low rating.The Beautiful Life was a teen drama on the CW that ran for only one season, with the network deciding to cancel after only two episodes aired. Also, according to television critics, there was a good reason for that.The series told the story of a group of young models living together in New York City and trying to make it on the fashion scene.It starred Mischa Barton, Sara Paxton, Ben Hollingsworth, and Corbin Bleu as some of the young models. Surprisingly, Gal Gadot was also cast to play a supermodel in later episodes, but these never reached to air.The Beautiful Life’s early cancellation was due to several reasons. Critics were irritated at the poorly produced melodrama, and many wrote that the show had flashy visuals with absolutely no substance to back it up.The Beautiful Life was also overly dramatic, while at the same time extremely boring.Essentially every television critic said that the series would never last due to these factors.With such a poorly rated first and only season, The Beautiful Life rests at a low 21% on Rotten Tomatoes.Kristen Bell is winning over television audiences around the world with her role in the current hit sitcom The Good Place, but back in the ‘00s, she starred in one of the most decade’s popular TV series, Veronica Mars.The CW series took the film noir concept into a storyline following modern day teens. Kristen Bell starred as high school student Veronica Mars who lives in Neptune, California and works as a private investigator. Each episode follows Bell’s titular character as she solves different mysteries.Though Veronica Mars didn't manage to pull in hugely impressive ratings, critics showed the series some love. They loved Bell’s confident lead performance, as well as the series’ original and modern take on the film noir genre, sharp writing, and its surprising inclusion of social commentary.The mystery and the high school TV series might be two genres that are played out, but critics insisted that Veronica Mars elevated both to new and impressive heights.Unfortunately, despite such high praise from critics, Veronica Mars was cancelled after three seasons. Fans remained loyal and were able to help creator Rob Thomas raise funds through Kickstarter for a Veronica Mars movie.They were successful, and the movie premiered in 2014, but the series never made its way back on television.Nevertheless, Veronica Mars is still remembered as one of the best series from the ‘00s, and its rating of 94% on Rotten Tomatoes reflects that.Ask fans of the crime genre what piece of media best captures the mob, and some might say movies like Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas or Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather trilogy.However, many others would name HBO’s record-breaking drama The Sopranos as the best work ever produced in the mobster crime genre.As one of the best series to come out of the premium network HBO, The Sopranos follows crime boss Tony Soprano (played in a career-defining performance by James Gandolfini) as he leads the New Jersey mob while balancing his home life with wife Carmela (Edie Falco) and children Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler) and AJ (Robert Iler) with the help of therapist Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco).At times chillingly violent, at times surprisingly funny, there’s no television series quite like The Sopranos.It quickly became one of the most popular series in American programming, and critics were quick to praise the HBO drama.Half of its seasons have received a perfect 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, with critics lauding The Sopranos’ emotional depth, philosophical themes, first-rate performances from its entire case, and its original take on the mobster genre.The series will forever be remembered as one of the best dramas ever made and is easily one of the best television productions to come out of the ‘00s.The Sopranos sits at an impressive 95% on Rotten Tomatoes.With smash-hit sci-fi movies like The Terminator and Aliens behind him, everybody thought that James Cameron would be an amazing filmmaker to bring to television in the ‘00s. Unfortunately, his television series Dark Angel didn't fare so well.In her breakout role, Jessica Alba starred as the genetically modified super-soldier teen Max Guevara. Dark Angel follows Guevara as she breaks out from the military compound that holds her and explores James Cameron’s vision of a post-apocalyptic Seattle, trying to survive out on her own.Dark Angel was promoted hard by Fox, which had devoted a huge budget to creating the series, and it did gain some fairly good ratings with its first season.Having secured decent ratings, the network thought its show was good to go.The critics, however, were not such big fans of James Cameron’s first foray into television. Many scoffed at the series’ poor scripts and awful one-liners, stiff performance by lead Jessica Alba, and its storyline’s aimless and just plain boring direction. The series was labeled as all style and no substance by critics.Dark Angel was unable to recuperate from such harsh criticism and was cancelled soon after. It now ranks with a mere 20% on Rotten Tomatoes.Damages showed audiences and critics what can happen when you have a knock-out A-list actor like Glenn Close leading a television series.The FX legal thriller Damages starred Close as main character Patty Hewes, a top-rate lawyer in Manhattan who specializes in corporate cases. Rose Byrne starred as Hewes’ protégée Ellen Parson. Other stars that appeared over the course of the series included William Hurt, Ted Danson, Martin Short, and Timothy Olyphant.However, it was Close who stood at the heart of Damages and lead the series into being the razor-sharp drama it is remembered for being today.Her steely, determined lead character impressed viewers nationwide and paved the way for equally strong female characters on network television in the future.With other popular shows like Law and Order, the legal drama might seem like a worn out genre. But critics relished in Damages’ refreshing and captivating take on melodramatic legal thrillers.Many praised Damages for its memorable, polished performances, masterful production and direction, and its downright addicting storylines.Not one of Damages’ five seasons ranked lower than 88% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the final three seasons each ranking at a perfect 100%.This gives Damages a near-perfect cumulative score of 96% on the famous critics’ website.If you asked someone what they believed the best show to come out of the ‘00s was, there’s a good chance they’d answer with Breaking Bad.The AMC drama took the entire world by storm after its thrilling first season, and through the years it proved itself as one of the best television series ever produced.Breaking Bad followed Bryan Cranston’s Walter White as he makes a jarring switch from his old job as a high school chemistry teacher to being a meth dealer after learning that he has cancer.Before the AMC series, American audiences knew Bryan Cranston best from his role on Malcolm in the Middle. However, by playing Walter White, he stunned audiences with his career-defining performance and made a serious impression on casual viewers at home and critics alike.However, it wasn't only Cranston’s amazing performance that drew in praise from television critics.They also found Breaking Bad’s storylines to be uniquely compelling, with the show going in completely unexpected directions with new twists every season. The series was also praised for its high production value and excellent writing and direction.Four out of five seasons of Breaking Bad received perfect 100% scores on Rotten Tomatoes, and the series finished out with an overall 96% on the website.Critics and television audiences at home often disagree on whether shows are actually good or not. However, with the 2006 series South Beach, the two groups reached an absolute agreement that the show was downright awful.South Beach, executive produced by Jennifer Lopez, followed the story of Vincent (Chris J. Johnson) and Matt (Marcus Coloma) as they move from Brooklyn to the South Beach neighborhood of Miami, Florida.There the two get caught up in various melodramas with women, family, and their work as burgeoning businessmen.Critics lambasted the series for its all-around awful performances, poor production value, boring and predictable storylines, and flat, unbelievable characters. With poor scripts, direction, and acting, it seemed like there was no aspect of South Beach that viewers were able to enjoy.South Beach ended up being one of the lowest rated series on air and stands today as one of the worst series of the entire ‘00s decade. It was no surprise that South Beach did not receive a renewal from the CW. The producers were so ashamed of the series’ low ratings that South Beach was never released on DVD or Blu-ray.With all of this considered, South Beach’s laughably low rating of 15% on Rotten Tomatoes makes complete sense.The Wire is one of those dramas that continues to represent the standard for successful television programming to this day.Set in Baltimore, HBO’s crime drama The Wire explored different aspects of law enforcement in the city through its individual seasons, including drug trade, city government, and education.In addition to its impressive cast with actors like Dominic West, Michael K. Williams, Idris Elba, and Michael B. Jordan, The Wire also pulled from real life in order to emphasize its realistic approach to the subject matter and used non-professional actors throughout the show as well.This quest for realism paid off. The Wire is still remembered and celebrated for its accuracy, complexity, and commentary on the social and political realities of cities like Baltimore.Television critics liked The Wire’s nuanced storytelling and that the showrunners depicted its subject matter in an unflinching, no-holds-barred manner. The series’ characters routinely drew praise from critics as well, and many of them insisted that The Wire was one of the top television dramas ever made as a result.Four out of five of The Wire’s series scored a flawless 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, giving the series an overall high rating of 97%.One of the quintessential American television dramas of the ‘00s is the NBC drama Friday Night Lights. The series followed a Texas high school football team and was based on the best-selling book written by H.G. Bissinger and adapted from the 2004 film with the same title.Kyle Chandler starred as the show’s lead, football coach Eric Taylor, and was joined by an impressive ensemble cast including Connie Britton, Michael B. Jordan, Taylor Kitsch, and Jesse Plemons.However, Friday Night Lights was more than just a sports drama. The series used its working class Texas setting to offer commentary on social issues and American culture as a whole, taking on topics such as the American family, race, substance use, and the American economy.Critics loved its take on such social issues and how Friday Night Lights was able to blend profound themes with the sports genre. Television critics also enjoyed the series’ strong cast performances, surprising narrative twists, and the heartfelt drama at the core of it all.Each season of Friday Night Lights has received an A grade from Rotten Tomatoes critics, with the lowest scoring first season still pulling an impressive 91% rating.As a result, Friday Night Lights sits at a high 97% rating overall on the site.Even some of the worst series are still able to pull double-digit ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. Not so for The Ghost Whisperer, which was so despised by critics that it was unable to break even a 10% overall rating.CBS’ supernatural drama starred Jennifer Love Hewitt as Melinda Gordon, a woman who has the mystical ability to see and talk to ghosts. She uses these skills to help ghosts solve the issues that are keeping them on earth while trying to keep a normal lifestyle on her own at the same time.The series was highly popular with viewers at home when it was on air and was actually one of CBS’ highest rated series, as the show consistently pulled in millions of views each week.However, The Ghost Whisperer did not receive the same level of love from critics by a long shot.Even though American audiences loved the drama, critics found it too melodramatic and overly sentimental. The series lacked the amount of depth critics look for, and many found Jennifer Love Hewitt’s lead performance to be lackluster. Some just found The Ghost Whisperer to be flat-out absurd.Still, despite its single-digit rating of 9% on Rotten Tomatoes as a result of its heavy criticism, The Ghost Whisperer remained popular through the ‘00s and ran on CBS for five seasons before being cancelled.HBO’s gritty and realistic western Deadwood is always named whenever there’s a conversation on excellent television series that were cancelled far too soon.Deadwood’s cast alone was enough to make it one of the most exciting series from the ‘00s.Actors Timothy Olyphant, Ian McShane, Molly Parker, and John Hawkes formed the series’ cast, all playing characters based on real-life figures from the real lawless frontier town of Deadwood, South Dakota.With its refreshingly realistic take on the western genre, Deadwood immediately caught the eyes of television critics. Its honest and unflashy depictions of the history American west, excellent writing, and top-notch performances earned Deadwood a score of 100% for each of its seasons.Some critics even argued that it was the strongest drama to ever hit American television.When it was on air, Deadwood was one of the strongest shows in HBO’s roster. It’s still considered among HBO’s best dramas today. Deadwood enjoyed a three season run before it was cut down in its prime.There have been rumors of a movie that would reunite the original cast, but that production’s fate is still questionable. Fans may never get new Deadwood material ever again.Nevertheless, it is still remembered as one of the best dramas ever put to television, and Deadwood’s perfect score of 100% reflects its memorable status.Many critics would argue that they consider Band of Brothers to be the best series to come out of the ‘00s. The visceral, unnerving depiction of World War II framed the legendary conflict in a new light, emphasizing the tragic sacrifices many in the American Armed Forces had to make in order to win the war.The HBO series told the story of the “Easy Company,” a part of the Parachute Infantry Regiment of the US 101st Airborne Division during World War II. The series spanned the Company’s time from training in the United States to the end of the war.The series also featured an extraordinary ensemble cast. Band of Brothers served as a stepping-stone for many of today’s A-list actors to grow the huge careers they’re known for having today.Actors such as Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, Michael Fassbender, Stephen Graham, Colin Hanks, Simon Pegg, and Tom Hardy all starred in Band of Brothers.Also, their knockout performances weren’t the only aspects of the HBO drama that garnered critical acclaim. The series’ shocking intensity, engrossing drama, and its realistic characters’ heroic exploits all won over critics’ favor.It was remarkable qualities such as these that has earned Band of Brothers its flawless 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.Paul Haggis’ 2004 movie Crash was one of the strongest drama films to come out of the ‘00s and is still celebrated today for its emotional depth and award-winning performances.So when it was announced some years later that Starz would be adapting the series for television, many grew excited, hoping a classic could grow out of the adaptation.However, Starz’s Crash did not enjoy much success. Instead, the show is considered one of the biggest television failures of the ‘00s.Developed by Glen Mazzara, who is best known today for his work on The Shield and The Walking Dead, Crash starred Dennis Hopper, D.B. Sweeney, and Dana Ashbrook. The series told the story of an array of different characters living in Los Angeles attempting to find their own versions of success.All of the subtleties that contributed to the success of the original 2004 movie were lost on Mazzara’s television adaptation. According to critics, even though the series attempted to take on heavy social themes, it floundering under the weight and only ended up preaching to its audience.In addition to its heavy-handedness, critics found the series too self important, while the storylines were found completely ridiculous and the performances were described as flat and uninspired.Crash was cancelled after two seasons and remains today as one of the lowest-rated series of the ‘00s, with an embarrassing 7% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.---How did your favorite series from the '00s fare?

Say what you will about 2016, but the year finished strong with both critics and audiences. Damien Chazelle's awards-friendly musical La La Land finally opened in theaters (albeit in a gradual rollout designed to build buzz), while Rogue One: A Star Wars Story catapulted into the year's top three highest-grossing films. However, December was also marked by some less successful releases as well, namely the video game adaptation Assassin's Creed -- which seemingly confirmed how difficult it is for the world of gaming to cross over into big-screen success -- and the star-studded but critically panned Collateral Beauty.Although January isn't traditionally the most fruitful of months when it comes to films (aside from the lingering Oscar bait that tends to stick around for a while longer), 2017 may be off to a stronger start than usual, with some high-profile sequels and promising horror films among the offerings coming moviegoers' way. To kick off the new year, let's take a closer look at the first batch of releases hitting theaters in the coming weeks.Here are 10 films to check out in January 2017:Underworld: Blood Wars (Release Date: January 6)Since 2003, Kate Beckinsale has played the vampire assassin Selene in the Underworld franchise, and while the series has never been a critical favorite, its fan base has remained loyal over the years. In fact, the ongoing vampire/Lycan war has earned more than $500 at the worldwide box office across its four installments, with 2012 release Underworld: Awakening serving as the highest-grossing to date.The followup, Underworld: Blood Wars, sees Selene out to protect her daughter from both the vampire and Lycans, as she seeks a way to bring their eternal conflict to an end. Directed by Anna Foerster, this fifth entry hopes to keep the franchise alive for years to come, as both a sixth Underworld film and a television series remain in development.Check out the latest trailer for Underworld: Blood Wars.A Monster Calls (Release Date: January 6)Based on the Patrick Ness novel, A Monster Calls tells the story of a young boy named Conor (Lewis MacDougall) coping with his mother's (Felicity Jones) terminal illness. In this time of emotional crisis, he meets a humanoid tree -- the titular "monster," voiced by Liam Neeson -- and a friendship is born that offers an escape from the harsh reality Conor must endure.The film -- directed by acclaimed filmmaker J.A. Bayona (The Orphanage) -- aims to use fantastical elements as an allegory of how people deal with pain and grief. Considering that Ness himself is the screenwriter on the project, chances are strong this adaptation will retain that sentiment. Thus far, the critical response to the film has been overwhelmingly positive, boding well for its moving tale.Check out the latest trailer for A Monster Calls.The Bye Bye Man (Release Date: January 13)Horror is often among the most subjective genres of filmmaking. What one moviegoer finds terrifying might feel derivative and flat to another. It's unclear exactly which category The Bye Bye Man will fall into, but the latest film from director Stacy Title (Let the Devil Wear Black) certainly has promise, especially seeing how it's one of the few horror films making their way to theaters this month.The Bye Bye Man centers on a trio of college students who become haunted the eponymous supernatural creature, who may or may not have been responsible for a string of killing sprees in recent years. There's the real opportunity here for Title's film to explore a bit of social commentary, but even if it doesn't seize that chance, Doug Jones' performance as the mysterious antagonist will likely be a highlight.Check out the latest trailer for The Bye Bye Man.Monster Trucks (Release Date: January 13)Sure, the premise of Monster Trucks -- in which a high-schooler (Lucas Till) winds up with a truck inhabited by a monstrous creature -- is more than a bit goofy, but there's hope yet that director Chris Wedge (Ice Age) can deliver a fun adventure for the whole family with this one. After all, its story does feel like a throwback to 1980s films like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.Till may still be best known for his role as MacGyver in the CBS reboot, but in Monster Trucks, he's accompanied by a strong supporting cast that includes Jane Levy (Don't Breathe), Amy Ryan, Rob Lowe, and Danny Glover. Families who have caught up on all the holiday films might want to give this one a shot, especially as ones of the few releases this month specifically aimed at younger viewers.Check out the latest trailer for Monster Trucks.The Founder (Release Date: January 20)Ever since his Oscar-nominated lead performance in Birdman, Michael Keaton has seen his career resurge in ways that most actors of his generation can only hope for. The Batman star played a key role in Best Picture winner Spotlight and is set to rejoin the world of comic book films as the Vulture in Spider-Man: Homecoming later this year.Yet, before he does so, Keaton will breathe life into the story of Ray Kroc, the businessman who acquired McDonald's in 1961 from founders Dick and Mac McDonald. Director John Lee Hancock specializes in turning real-life stories into hit films (The Rookie, The Blind Side, Saving Mr. Banks). We suspect that The Founder -- which looks to balance a bit of satire into its own account of Kroc's McDonalds purchase -- will follow suit.Check out the latest trailer for The Founder.Split (Release Date: January 20)Not so long ago, M. Night Shyamalan seemed to be an industry pariah. However, 2015 horror film The Visit offered the director a bit of redemption. In addition to earning mostly strong reviews, the $5 million film went on to bring in $65 million at the domestic box office.By all accounts, Split may be able to keep Shyamalan's hit streak rolling along. Starring James McAvoy as a kidnapper suffering from dissociative identity disorder, the film could simply be a showcase for McAvoy's onscreen range, but with 2016 breakout Anya Taylor-Joy among its cast and strong reviews coming out of its festival run, we're hoping that Shyamalan has officially reclaimed his title as a powerful horror director.Check out the latest trailer for Split.xXx: Return of Xander Cage (Release Date: January 20)Back in the early 2000s, Vin Diesel's career seemed to be on fire. Between Pitch Black, The Fast and the Furious and xXx, the action star had three popular roles (and potential franchises) in the can. Though he would ultimately revisit Richard B. Riddick and Dominic Toretto in future films, Diesel seemingly missed out on his chance to headline any sequels to xXx, having missed out on the 2005 sequel.Now, 15 years after first playing the extreme sports junkie-turned-spy, Diesel is back as the title character in  xXx: Return of Xander Cage. Despite the fact that a short film seemingly confirmed Cage's death, he resurfaces to race the villainous Xiang (Donnie Yen) and winds up recruiting a team to help him complete a top-secret mission. Even though the premise sounds eerily similar to a Fast and Furious film, we're curious to see if this third xXx film connects with audiences like the first one did.Check out the latest trailer for xXx: The Return of Xander Cage.The Red Turtle (Release Date: January 20)With three animated films among the most successful of the year, 2016 was a tremendously profitable time for animation. However, while American audiences had plenty of chances to see the latest Disney and Universal animated films, this French release -- which is heavily tipped to earn a Best Animated Feature Oscar nod -- is only now getting a limited theatrical run in North America.Featuring no dialogue, The Red Turtle -- a co-production between French company Wild Bunch and famed Japanese house Studio Ghibli -- tells the story of a shipwrecked man who befriends a giant red turtle, and while its plot is simple, the film has received universal acclaim for its visual style and storytelling technique. Dutch-British animator Michaël Dudok de Wit makes his feature directorial debut here.Check out the latest trailer for The Red Turtle.Gold (Release Date: January 27)Matthew McConaughey stars as businessman Kenny Wells in this crime adventure from director Stephen Gaghan (Syriana). Wells teams with a geologist (Édgar Ramírez) to find gold in the Indonesian jungle. Though Gold began hitting theaters in December 2016, it receives a wide release this month, hoping to redeem McConaughey's summer 2016 misfire Free State of Jones.With a script by Patrick Massett and John Zinman (Lara Croft: Tomb Raider), Gold could stand apart as one of the few original adventure films coming out this month. In addition to McConaughey and Ramírez, the film features Bryce Dallas Howard, Joshua Harto, Corey Stoll, Toby Kebbell, and Bill Camp. It will also marks McConaughey's final big-screen role before he stars alongside Idris Elba in The Dark Tower.Check out the latest trailer for Gold.Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (Release Date: January 27)For 15 years, Milla Jovovich has proven that a popular video game series can be adapted into a financially successful film franchise. As Alice -- the central figure of the Resident Evil films -- the actress has taken on the Umbrella Corporation and hordes of zombies in five films, and the sixth entry, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter, aims to wrap up the series in epic fashion once and for all.A number of familiar faces from the franchise's history return to help Alice in one last showdown with Umbrella in Raccoon City, where the apocalypse started in the first place. Paul W.S. Anderson writes and directs this one, which should easily push the Resident Evil franchise reach a cumulative worldwide box office gross of $1 billion. Not too shabby.Check out the latest trailer for Resident Evil: The Final Chapter.-While many more exciting months may still await moviegoers in 2017, January brings several potential blockbusters to theaters, kicking the year off in style. Although the first quarter of any year is traditionally a quieter time in which the industry's awards season kicks into high gear, we're confident that this month brings a release or two you'll be excited to see. Let us know in the comments which films you'll be checking out in January.Once again, here are the 10 films to check out in January:January 6: Underworld: Blood Wars, A Monster CallsJanuary 13: The Bye Bye Man, Monster TrucksJanuary 20: The Founder, Split, xXx: The Return of Xander Cage, The Red TurtleJanuary 27: Gold, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter

The 1990s represented a real time of cultural change and creative progress in the world of the entertainment industry. Following the experimental and witty period of the 1980s, the 1990s allowed for creatives to take stock of what had worked, and what definitely hadn't, in order to keep producing art that would mean something - and, of course, sell tickets.Viewers flocked to their televisions in the tens of millions to watch the adventures of the Central Perk gang, or Frasier and Niles, or Martin and Tommy and Gina. The Seinfeld series finale is still one of the most contentious pieces of pop culture, even after all these years.In the world of film, Disney was going full steam ahead during their Renaissance period, and Pixar would begin making a name for itself then, too. The careers of future Hollywood icons like Jennifer Aniston, Matt Damon, and George Clooney would burst out into the cultural consciousness during that time period as well.However, for all the highs of the entertainment produced in the 1990s, there were definitely many, many lows - and some pretty embarrassing ones, at that. At least according to Rotten Tomatoes scores, the disparities between the best and the worst of the films of the '90s are quite surprising.Here are the 10 Best (And 10 Worst) '90s Movies According To Rotten Tomatoes.Click the button below to start this article in quick viewHard as it may be to imagine, someone, somewhere, once thought it would be a good idea to make a film starring Carrot Top as a surfer bro who, through sheer dumb luck, winds up the head of an incredibly profitable company. Chairman of the Board was released in 1998 to the near universal disdain of critics, going so far as to earn two Razzie nominations for Worst New Actor and Worst Supporting Actress.Beyond the ludicrous initial premise of the movie, the details that follow are even more dumbfounding.Some of the key items used in the plot are a hybrid television and TV dinner, an inherited surfboard, and goo that glows in the dark. The real mystery here is how this film even managed to score as high as a 13% on the Tomatometer.As we’ve previously mentioned, Disney had a real hot streak leading into the 1990s as the company entered the period that would come to be known as the Disney Renaissance. One of its biggest successes and most beloved films in this period is the 1992 classic, Aladdin, which scores in at a 94% on the Tomatometer.Buoyed by the voice work of a lifetime by the legendary Robin Williams as the wish-granting Genie, Aladdin has the heart of the best Disney movies, and the irreverent wit that the earlier films were lacking. Supported by a lively soundtrack, featuring classics such as “Friend Like Me” and “A Whole New World”, it was only a matter of time before the film entered the illustrious canon of the best Disney films ever made.It's hard work adapting a superhero franchise into film. Even in this day and age of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and, well, Wonder Woman, superhero adaptations can truly be hit or miss. There's a reason, after all, that we said Wonder Woman, and not the DCEU as a whole. We don't want to touch that one with a ten-foot pole. However, for the most part, superhero movies nowadays are legions better than they were in the 1990s - and the stark contrast between recent superhero films and 1997's Batman and Robin offers a clear cut example of that.Most movies in the superhero genre these days are pretty dark and gritty, action-heavy stories. Occasionally, lighter fare like Ant-Man or Deadpool enters the canon. However, Batman and Robin was a bloated, joke-heavy film featuring far too many characters to make any meaningful story, and far too many bad jokes to allow for any movement of plot or connections. Its 10% on Rotten Tomatoes is sadly all too well earned.Sometimes, art in its best form exists to challenge people, to stir up controversy, and to create conversations that have often been avoided. Films like the 1992 Academy award winner The Crying Game fit precisely in this complicated nexus of categories. The movie takes place in the contentious period of Irish history known as The Troubles, featuring a truly disparate cast of core characters that allow it to explore the struggles of Irish and British citizens through the lenses of class, gender, and race.It's perhaps one of the more uncomfortable movies on this list to discuss at great length, purely because of the ugly truths it reveals about what humans are capable of when at their worst.However, by prominently featuring such a diverse cast from all walks of life and including a lead transgender character, The Crying Game broke the silence on many social issues that desperately needed to be discussed, and therefore rightfully deserves its grade of 95%.Apparently, nothing says "this should be a plot of a romantic comedy!" like a group of preteen boys enlisting the services of a street worker to help them learn about women. The initial premise is definitely bawdier than most rom coms, and that's even before the romantic part of the plot is forced into existence.The year 1994's Milk Money finds a group of young boys desperate to learn the truth about women - including their anatomy. When they meet a street worker who's willing to help them out, nothing about this apparently set off any warning signs or alarms for the characters in the film, or the creators behind the making of it - but hey, it's okay. The street worker and one of the boys' fathers wind up falling in love, so there's nothing surprising to see here, not at all. Not even the confusing mob money storyline that takes up far too much of the movie.Sometimes, big isn't better, and the smallest movies can turn out to be some of the best ever made. The 1994 British romantic comedy Four Weddings and a Funeral is a prime example of this notion. Made on a budget of less than $3 million, the film would go on to gross nearly $250 million in its theatrical release - and for good reason, too. Starring the then up and comer Hugh Grant, the genuinely affecting story follows a group of close friends as they navigate love and loss.Even in its cheesiest moments, Four Weddings feels fresh, funny, and full of warmth. It masters the craft of the romantic comedy without ever feeling schmaltzy and overdone, more than earning the 95% Certified Fresh ranking it currently bears on Rotten Tomatoes.It wasn't just Batman and Robin that showed how poorly conceived superhero films could be in the 1990s. The 1990 adaptation of Captain America may have even been worse in many ways. Some of the beats the story of the film hits are similar in many ways to Captain America: The First Avenger - except for the fact that, well, that film worked tremendously well, and this one... did not, in any way.The overall look of both Captain America and the Red Skull is garish and overdone.The acting is truly shoddy, and the film's production was riddled with so much trouble that, despite being intended for a theatrical release during production, it wound up being released direct to video after a couple years of delay.It's not every day that a movie has the unenviable task of making a monstrous, psychopathic cannibal into a compelling, fascinating, entertaining character. Yet somehow, not only was that the exact task 1991's The Silence of the Lambs was forced to deal with - it was also one they completely succeeded in meeting. The Silence of the Lambs is, by all accounts, a horror movie - sure, it's one infused with aspects of a mystery and thriller, but a horror film all the same. In that regard, the film accomplished considerable feats that are almost unheard of in the world of horror.It was the winner of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay at the Oscars, and has long been considered one of the best films ever made, in large part due to the performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. The 95%, in some sense, seems almost too low for a film of such high regard and quality.Mr. Magoo is a character that has never really been culturally sensitive in any form. Whether in the frequently racist cartoons, or in 1997's Leslie Nielsen starrer, the character has led to a lot of controversy in its lengthy tenure. The simply titled Mr. Magoo found Leslie Nielsen tasked with bringing the often-clueless cartoon character to life. J. Quincy Magoo's adventures may have been amusing and outlandish in cartoon form, but in live action, they're just plain unbearable to sit through.However, thankfully for any potential viewers at the time, the film was faced with a far greater challenge: in addition to being a just plain bad story, it was found to be completely offensive to blind and near-sighted people. The 7% movie was even pulled from theatres only two weeks into its release.Mafia movies are incredibly common in Hollywood, with The Godfather and The Godfather II often hailed as some of the best movies ever made. But beyond The Godfather series, Goodfellas stands out as one of the strongest crime films ever produced, with the added bonus of being inspired by a true story.While the movie was merely a modest box office success, nearly earning double its $25 million budget, it was a massive critical success, resulting in six Oscar nominations and a win for supporting actor Joe Pesci.Rotten Tomatoes is so bold as to claim the movie as "the high point of Martin Scorcese's career," and when you look at all the film accomplished, thematically and stylistically and on sheer story and casting levels, it's hard not to agree with them. While it may not be The Godfather, there's no denying that the 96% rating the film holds is well-earned.It's not every day that you come across a movie that was marketed as a sequel to a film it truly has absolutely nothing to do with. The reported original, Troll, was released in 1986 and only has a 25% on Rotten Tomatoes. So it's not like there were very large shoes to fill, when Troll 2 was released in 1990. And yet, it managed to do even worse, earning a pathetic 6% on the Tomatometer.Of course, Troll 2 really has nothing to do with Troll, the mothership. There aren't even any trolls in the movie, but vegetarian goblins who turn people into vegetable goop, because why not? The film is far and wide considered one of the worst ever made, and yet, it lives on in infamy on the internet these days, frequently discussed and turned into memes and GIFs whenever the need arises for such things.Stop us if you've heard this one before. You'd be hard pressed to find a better comedy film to come out of the 1990s than the Bill Murray starring classic Groundhog Day. With a lofty 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the film stands far and away as one of the best rated comedies of the '90s, if not all time.While Murray may have built his career with the likes of Saturday Night Live and the Ghostbusters films, Groundhog Day stands as perhaps the best representation of what his talents are really capable of. The movie has become such a cult classic hit that it would even go on to become a Broadway musical in the 2016 season.This definitely isn't the story of The Avengers you're thinking of. The 1998 film was a remake of the hit 1960s British spy series that aired nearly 200 episodes from 1961 to 1969. Despite having considerable star power among its cast, including Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and Sean Connery, this very well may be one of the worst British to American translation adaptations ever produced.Critics found the movie to be terribly dull in terms of its story (or lack thereof), and with almost all characters miscast, no matter the otherwise strength of the actors in other projects.The film failed to make back its budget of $60 million, which all but guaranteed its status as a box office bomb, and makes it more than deserve its paltry 5% rating.As we've seen so far, the length and strength of an actor's career prior to a project doesn't by any means guarantee whether the film will be a success. Harrison Ford may have been a star for the 1970s and 1980s, but by the time the 1990s rolled around, it wasn't a sure thing that his star power would continue to hold audience attention.However, the 1993 movie The Fugitive quickly put an end to any and all wondering, showing that the 96% rating it's been given on Rotten Tomatoes is entirely deserved. The film is emotionally gripping, a chase movie with real stakes that most action movies lack across the board. Harrison Ford's performance is a powerhouse, one of the strongest of his career, and Tommy Lee Jones similarly steals the show, even winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1994.The 1990s had a lot to live up to when it came to embracing the level of creativity and originality on display in the best films of the 1980s. The cult hit Who Framed Roger Rabbit was released in 1988 to wide acclaim, earning it a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes for its seamless blending of animation and live action.So it was inevitable, really, that imitations would come along - and likewise inevitable that they would never be as good as the Robert Zemeckis flick. The year 1992's Cool World is perhaps the most egregious example of a film that tried to be Roger Rabbit, and failed in every possible way. No matter its impressive animation, the film was darker, raunchier, and all the more uncomfortable to view because of it.Few Academy award-winning films can boast the fact that they were written by relative newcomer twentysomethings, and that the script started as an assignment in a course for Harvard. However, that's exactly the case of the now iconic 1997 film Good Will Hunting, which clocks in at a much-deserved 97% on Rotten Tomatoes.The movie put future A-listers Matt Damon and the Affleck brothers on the map, offering a glimpse at the then culturally-ignored world of South Boston's working class.With stunningly emotional work by Robin Williams, who earned the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and the young Damon, Good Will Hunting manages to tread familiar beats in a way that doesn't feel tired or overwrought. Will Hunting's story is uniquely his own, full of life and color and pain and love, beautifully directed by Gus Van Sant and scored to perfection by Danny Elfman.For some reason, Hollywood was convinced for a while that movies with talking babies were guaranteed to be sure fire hits. The '80s and '90s brought us films like Look Who's Talking, Look Who's Talking Too, and Look Who's Talking Now. However, 1999 brought us the film Baby Geniuses, which featured some considerable talent with the likes of Kathleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd, Peter MacNicol, and Dom DeLuise in its cast.However, unfortunately, it also featured a group of creepily CGI edited talking babies who, as a result of scientific experimentation, are now super geniuses. Nothing about the movie works, and no amount of talented adult casting could have helped it. It's no wonder that, in addition to a truly embarrassing 2% on Rotten Tomatoes, the film's consensus on the site reads, "Flat direction and actors who look embarrassed to be onscreen make Baby Geniuses worse than the premise suggests."Out of all the films on this list, L.A. Confidential may be the most affected by time. As a result of the revelations about Kevin Spacey during the #MeToo and #TimesUp era, it's hard to look back on his career and evaluate his work with an even mind. However, the 1997 movie L.A. Confidential stands out as one of the best of the 1990s for much more than just Spacey's performance.The film currently holds a strong 99% Certified Fresh ranking on Rotten Tomatoes, with only one review in the entire record being classified as a negative one. The movie was a hit at Cannes, a hit with critics, and a hit with audiences. It was nominated for a whopping nine Academy Awards, and has been chosen by the Library of Congress to be preserved as a significant cultural work.The pairing of Gene Hackman and Dan Aykroyd doesn't exactly sound like one that would lead to the best comedy ever made - and... well, that assumption would be all too correct. Loose Cannons may just have one of the most absurd, offensive starting premises of any movie made in recent decades: two police officers are tasked with finding and exposing an adult tape featuring a current male politician from Germany and a young former leader.Upon its release, the movie was universally panned, and to this day maintains a true goose egg score of 0% on Rotten Tomatoes, a feat that almost takes an impressive capability of being unabashedly awful.Even Aykroyd all but renounces his role in the movie, claiming in 2013 that it belongs in a landfill.Few movies have fundamentally changed the world of animation in the way that Toy Story did in 1995. Beyond introducing a relatively new form of animation to the world, the film introduced a story that didn't have to be totally defined by the archetypal hero's journey or princess narrative that Disney films had become so renowned for.Instead, Toy Story offers a story of jealousy, of hurt, of unlikely allies forced to work together to save their skins. It's a story of adventure and friendship and, ultimately, the nature of consciousness, hard as it may be to believe. For a kids' movie, it can get pretty intense at times. With a perfectly chosen voice cast including Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Wallace Shawn, and John Ratzenberger, Toy Story created instantly iconic characters, all by showing that toys have feelings, too. If that doesn't deserve a 100%, we're not sure what does.---What do you think were the best and worst of 1990s movies?

Just because Halloween is over doesn't mean the horrors have to end. In fact, for many of these series, the spooks and scares are only beginning with season one. A new string of debut shows recently hit Netflix and are quickly becoming everyone's favorite subject. The Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina, Haunted, and The Haunting Of Hill House dominate Netflix right now, but some of us aren't scared of the paranormal or don't believe in it. That's why we included Mindhunter and Black Mirror, two shows that are much too real in their delivery of serial killers and techno-paranoia. The one show we didn't feel the need to mention here is The Walking Dead simply because it's already so popular and loved. But don't worry, there's room for comic relief on this list, too.While the haunted house angle may seem outdated and overdone these days, The Haunting Of Hill House breathes fresh life into the horror sub-genre. The storyline time jumps between the past and present while following the lives of the Crain family, who were once victim to the haunting of their childhood home. Now, as dysfunctional adults, they must come together to grieve the loss of their sibling. Medical records say she killed herself inside Hill House, but the Crain family know it's never that simple. She saw something. Felt something. Was possessed by something -- the same something as their mother many years ago.There are two types of people in this world: those who believe in ghosts, and those who don't. If all the lights suddenly go off in your home, you may automatically assume something spooky is going on, while your partner is convinced it's an outlet issue -- just tech stuff. If you're a non-believer in the creepy paranormal, Haunted might change your mind. Each 20-ish-minute episode tells the "true" story of a haunting from a first-person perspective. The haunted individual shares their experience with friends and family in a secluded room with interwoven dramatic scenes to help capture their true fear.No matter what your deepest, darkest fear is, American Horror Story has got you covered. In the past eight seasons, they've touched on witches, demons, clowns, vampires, the apocalypse, hospitals, hotels, an insane asylum -- even bondage figures in black latex suits. It's impossible to get bored of American Horror Story since every season invites brand new characters and a brand new storyline. Granted, a lot of the actors are the same. The most recent season begins with a nuclear blast that wipes out the world's entire population, excluding a group of civilians living in Outpost 3, an underground bunker dedicated to those with a strong genetic makeup.There's a reason Alfred Hitchcock is considered one of the founding fathers of horror. He's like the Stephen King of the movie world. Based on the movie Pyscho, arguably Hitchcock's greatest piece of work, Bates Motel follows the lives of mother-son duo Norma and Norman. Yep, you guessed it, they share a much-too-close relationship with absolutely zero privacy or personal space. That is, until Norman makes some new friends in town that rub Norma the wrong way. Not to mention there's also a murder, the hiding of a dead body, and the secret-keeping behind it. The coastal town of White Pine Bay is also keeping a few secrets of its own.Black Mirror isn't your typical goblins and ghouls TV show. In fact, it's the complete opposite. This series explores the "what ifs" of techno-paranoia. Each episode delves into a different component of technology, from online dating to posting reviews to being trapped inside a video game. Imagine for a second that the characters (and horse) in Red Dead Redemption were real. They had their own thoughts and opinions but were being forced to play your game as a modern form of slavery for all of eternity. Black Mirror treats technology as your best friend and worst enemy, a similar perspective to those of us who love and hate our iPhone at the same time.Nothing to see here, just a regular girl's 16th birthday party. Yeah, right. The Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina takes elements of Sabrina The Teenage Witch and turns the genre upside down. This new adaptation is far spookier and darker than the original. We first meet Sabrina on the eve of her 16th birthday party, during which she's expected to pledge loyalty to the Dark Lord Satan. Either that, or continue to live a relatively normal life as half-witch, half-mortal with her friends, family, and boyfriend. Madame Satan isn't giving up that easily, though. She's willing to do whatever it takes to bring Sabrina over to the dark side.Nothing coy about this one. If you want an absolute bloodbath packed with disturbing middle-of-the-night kills, turn on Slasher. The title says it all. The series begins with a woman who returns to her small hometown where her parents were brutally murdered by "The Executioner" on the night of her birth. No one has seen this man's face or has any clue about his identity. During the week of her return, a new string of murders takes place based on the seven deadly sins: envy, gluttony, greed, lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. One reviewer actually said this show made her scream out loud.It's amazing how horror and comedy can be so well intertwined. Cabin In The Woods nailed it and now it's trickling down into television shows like Ash Vs. Evil Dead and Stan Against Evil. Scary movie fans should know Ash from The Evil Dead, but this time around he's all grown up and carrying a chip on his shoulder toward the paranormal world. Who could blame him? With his chainsaw arm and monster-fighting friends, Ash was always prepared for the day that evil would come back to haunt him and lead him back to that deathly cabin. He's waited 30 years to kick monster butt.Stranger Things came out of nowhere and was an immediate massive success for Netflix. Starring Winona Ryder, Stranger Things takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana in the '80s. The Hawkins National Laboratory is inadvertently responsible for creating "the Upside Down" after conducting experiments on the paranormal and supernatural, sometimes using human subjects. The "Upside Down" abducts Will Byers in season one at the same as Eleven, a girl with special powers, escapes from the lab. Season two picks up a year after Will's rescue when his group of friends realizes there's more to the "Upside Down" than they ever imagined.Season two of Mindhunter is expected to air in 2019 -- but what's the big deal, right? Well, this series just goes to show that the worst monsters are real. They're walking among us. They look just like us. There are no ghosts or goblins in Mindhunter, just seemingly ordinary people who suddenly crack and carry out a string of murders. This based-on-true-events show explains how the term "serial killer" came to be. Ever wondered what was going through Ed Kemper's mind the day he decided to have intercourse with his mother's corpse? FBI agent Holden Ford is on a mission to find out.

There have always been a lot of good movies on Hulu, but 2019 has ushered in some absolute classics that the whole family will enjoy. Picking out the "best 10" wasn't easy, especially since it's so subjective, but we managed to select a variety of films from almost every possible genre. From animated classics like Shrek to cinematographic masterpieces like Silence, there truly is something for everyone on this list. Are you in the mood for a scare, a laugh, or a good cry? Hulu's got you covered. Here are 20 of the best movies on Hulu, streaming now.RELATED: The 25 Best Movies on Hulu Right NowCome on, who doesn't love the movie Shrek? This might make you feel old, but Shrek was released almost twenty years ago at the Cannes Film Festival. Hard to believe, right? Rocking a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes, this fairy tale film parody was (and is) enjoyed by almost everyone who sees it. In case you forgot, Shrek won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. Maybe it had something to do with the amazing narrators, particularly Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy, or the well-placed (and often well hidden) adult humor and themes, but Shrek was (and is) a freaking masterpiece.Even though I knew how it ended, Apollo 13 is utterly captivating from beginning to end, because the performances are just that good. Given that it was directed by the legendary Ron Howard and has an all-star cast, including Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon, they really couldn't go wrong with this one. Although it was released back in 1995, the film still maintains a 95% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and will forever be one of the top 5 astronaut movies of all time.RELATED: 5 Terrifying Real-Life Scenarios in MoviesMartin Scorsese's intense period drama, Silence, follows two 17th-century Jesuit priests who travel to Japan to locate their missing mentor and spread Catholic Christianity throughout the region. In true Scorcese fashion, the results are pretty horrifying, but the film's setting (Taiwan) and cinematography are absolutely breathtaking. The movie was a failure at the box office but was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography (well deserved) and maintains a respectable 83% on Rotten Tomatoes.It's relatively rare for a zombie movie to get an 86% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but 28 Days Later captured the imaginations of horror fans everywhere. After a highly contagious virus breaks out, four people struggle to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. Not exactly a new concept, but this British classic is credited with reinvigorating the zombie genre of horror film. In case you're still not sold on it, a poll was released in Time Out magazine that ranked it as the 97th best British film ever (and there have been a lot of them).RELATED: Alex Garland 'Doubts' 28 Months Later Will Ever HappenAnnihilation was only released a few months ago, but already it has an 89% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and was recently named by Barack Obama as one of his favorite movies of 2018. Not too shabby! If you're into science fiction, military scientists, and strong female leads, then this might be the film for you! Natalie Portman portrays a cellular-biology professor and former soldier who enters The Shimmer, an otherworldly quarantined zone created by a meteor striking Earth. What will she find when she's in there? You'll have to watch to find out.Considered by many to be the scariest movie of all time, The Exorcist is about the demonic possession and exorcism of a 12-year-old little girl, inspired by the 1949 real-life exorcism of Roland Doe. Creepily enough, the film had a troubled production that included an unexplained fire on set and multiple personal tragedies. All of the weird hype surrounding its creation paid off, because The Exorcist became one of the highest-grossing films in history and was nominated for ten Academy Awards (which was unheard of in the horror genre).RELATED: 10 Best Possession MoviesIt's often rare to watch a movie more than once, but Little Miss Sunshine is just. that. good. Good enough to actually buy, and watch again and again. The movie, which stars a very young Abigail Breslin, chronicles a quirky and dysfunctional family's cross-country road trip to get their daughter to the finals of a beauty pageant, come hell or high water. It doesn't sound like much on paper, but the film explores some really interesting themes, including unconditional love, body positivity, and society's concepts of "winning" and "losing." It's truly fabulous, and its 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes speaks for itself.Love Actually might have just been removed from Netflix in 2019, but it is now readily available on Hulu. For those who haven't already seen it, the film is a romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, and countless other famous Brits you would easily recognize from the silver screen. The love theme explores the different lives of many individuals whose stories are all intertwined by the end of the film. It's definitely a gooey-gooey feel-good movie, but God knows we need more of those in the world right now.RELATED: 20 Details Behind The Making Of Love ActuallyAnyone who has watched this as a child will remember just how terrifying it is! Cujo, which is rumored to be getting a remake, was first released in 1983 and was based on the novel by Stephen King. This film is a horror cult classic, and viewers can only watch helplessly as a rabid St. Bernard mercilessly terrorizes a mother who is trapped inside a hot car with her young child. It's brutal, it's painful, and it proves that horror movies don't need a huge budget to make us pee our pants.Everyone in their mid-to-late thirties can rejoice, because The Neverending Story has finally come to Hulu and they can relive their childhood once again. Although it wasn't exactly the easiest movie to make, this film's weird AF scenes are burned into the memories of every child who ever watched it. There are several kids with odd names, a magical land called Fantastica that's ruled by a creepy child empress, a massive flying shih-tzu dragon hybrid called Falkor, an oracle, a haunting scene involving the death of a horse...they just don't make kids' movies like this anymore! If you think you just imagined how insane it was, you thought wrong. Ah, the '80s.

Family movie night is the best. It's the perfect chance to spend some time with the people that we love most and also watch an entertaining flick. When we have kids, we can't wait to show them some of our favorite movies and have them fall in love with the stories that we adored when we were growing up. Another great thing about family movie night is that it gives us the opportunity to talk about some of the characters and themes in the films that we're curling up in front of.It's time to pass the pizza and popcorn (and maybe some chocolate) and get watching. Here are the 10 best movies to watch with your kids on family night.SEE ALSO: Big Hero 6 Cast Returns for Kingdom Hearts 3Click the button below to start this article in quick viewThe 2015 Pixar film is all about emotion... literally.The story follows Riley Anderson (Kaitlyn Dias) as she and her mom (Diane Lane) and dad (Kyle MacLachlan) move to another city. The movie goes inside her head to explore five emotions: Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Joy (Amy Poehler and Anger (Lewis Black). It's a truly sweet and heartwarming film that any kid (and adult) will love since the themes are realistic and perfect for chatting about afterward (while munching on more popcorn, of course). It's hard to imagine a better film to teach kids about their feelings and how to properly process them.SEE ALSO: Incredibles 2 Honest Trailer: Another Passable Pixar SequelIs there a more classic kids movie than Toy Story? Probably not, which is why it's another perfect pick for family movie night.The 1995 Pixar movie may look primitive by today's moviemaking standards but it's also historic because it was the first feature-length computer-animated film. These days, everything is computer animated, so it's cool to look back at this flick. The storyline follows toys who can talk and act real, namely Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) as they settle their differences and become friends. That's a great lesson to impart to children, and we'll enjoy the nostalgia of this movie, too.SEE ALSO: 25 Disney Heroes Reimagined As VillainsThe 2012 Disney film follows video game/arcade characters Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly), Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun (Jane Lynch), Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) and Fix-It Felix Jr (Jack McBrayer).It's one of the best movies for family night because kids will enjoy the colorful animation and adults will be impressed by the well-written script and feel a sense of nostalgia for playing video and arcade games while growing up.The sequel, Ralph Breaks The Internet, comes out in late November 2018, so in just a few months we can watch that for another family movie night. Our kids will beg us to watch that one, too.SEE ALSO: Frozen 2 Release Date Moved Up One Week in 2019The voice cast of this movie is perfect, it's endlessly quotable, and it's silly enough for kids but clever enough for adults. Released in 2000 by Disney, The Emperor's New Groove is another great pick for family movie night.David Spade is the voice of an emperor named Kuzco who is turned into a nice llama and has to figure out that being a good person is something that he should consider (another awesome lesson for little ones). John Goodman voices Pacha, the leader of the village. It's a simply hilarious movie that anyone will enjoy and it should be on our list for sure.SEE ALSO: Disney’s Star Wars Already Turns A Profit On Lucasfilm PurchaseDo we want to watch a hilarious animated film about animals who dare to go over the hedge to steal food from humans who live in the suburbs? Of course we do. If we've seen the 2006 Dreamworks film Over The Hedge, we can't wait to show this hilarious flick to our children.The voice cast is stellar, from Garry Shandling's turtle named Verne who decides to brave the human world to find food for his animal pals to Steve Carrel's squirrel named Hammy who can't stop moving around. It's sweet to watch these animals care for each other and also just plain funny to watch them see how much junk food humans eat.SEE ALSO: Tom Hanks Got Very Emotional Recording Toy Story 4’s EndingClassics exist for a reason and there are many animated movies which stand the test of time. The Lion King is one of them.As we get older, we realize how totally sad this movie is, but when we're kids, we simply enjoy the fun story of Simba (voiced by Matthew Broderick) and his sidekicks Nala (voiced by Moira Kelly), Pumbaa (voiced by Ernie Sabella), and Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane).The 1994 Disney movie is a perfect movie night pick for our family since it has beautiful music (written by the super talented Elton John) and colorful animation and a plot that keeps everyone interested. And we can all hate Simba's uncle Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons) together.SEE ALSO: The Grinch Review: A Delightful, Modern Retelling Of A Christmas ClassicThe R.L. Stine book series was most likely a staple of our childhoods and the 2015 Rob Letterman-directed film, starring Jack Black and Dylan Minnette, should be a staple of our kids' childhoods as well (along with the books, of course). This movie is a charming tale about Minnette's teenage boy character Zach who moves next door to Hannah (Odeya Rush) and realizes that her dad is none other than R.L. Stine. They open some of his novels and all of the monsters and creatures descend upon the town. Oops. We'll need extra popcorn for this fun and thrilling film.SEE ALSO: Harry Potter: 10 Characters Voldemort Was Close With (And 10 He Couldn’t Stand)"Inconceivable." “As you wish...” "This is my favorite book in all the world, though I have never read it.”These are just a few lines from the classic movie The Princess Bride. Released in 1987, the Rob Reiner-directed film stars Robin Wright as the Princess Bride, also named Buttercup, along with Cary Elwes as Westley and Wallace Shawn as Vizzini. It would be a crime not to watch it at least once during your childhood (and it definitely needs multiple viewings). Your kids will fall in love with the story of star-crossed lovers who must face many obstacles (and the film includes a story within a story since it is also about the tale that a grandpa tells his ill grandchild).SEE ALSO: Fantastic Beasts & Harry Potter’s Different Grindelwalds Risk A Timeline ProblemA list about the best movies for family movie night has to include the Steven Spielberg-directed E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial In the 1982 film, Henry Thomas stars as a boy named Elliot who meets an alien and becomes friends with him, along with his brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton) and sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore in a beloved role). It couldn't be more heartwarming and adorable if it tried. It's a must-see.We should definitely watch this with our kids, if only so they can hear the classic line "E.T. phone home" (and repeat it to us all the time and then laugh hysterically as kids are prone to do).SEE ALSO: Ron Howard Open to Directing Another Star Wars MovieFinally, we have Coco, the 2017 animated Pixar film that follows 12-year-old Miguel who dreams of making music (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez) and his great-grandma, Coco.There has been a lot of buzz around this film and for good reason. What is so wonderful about this movie (and what helped it win Best Animated Feature Film at the 2018 Academy Awards) is the singing and dancing. This movie is what can definitely be described as a feast for the senses, and our kids won't be able to stop smiling and humming along. These ten films are movie night magic and perfection.READ MORE: Can You Name All These Movies From 2017?

Be prepared to never sleep again. Don't say we didn't warn you -- these horror flicks are not for the faint-hearted. While it may seem that possession movies are overdone these days and none of them are that different or unique from each other, we've rounded up 10 of the very best guaranteed to make you quiver in the dark. The possession sub-genre is undoubtedly crowded with competition, making the task of narrowing down the top 10 nearly impossible. But we did it. Grab some popcorn, turn down the lights (okay, maybe not all of them), and press play... if you dare.We cannot -- and will not -- discuss possession movies without tipping our hat to The Exorcist. Seriously, you don't understand. This 1973 classic is what started it all. What makes it even scarier is that it's loosely based on actual events. When Regan starts acting strange (speaking in tongues and levitating), her mother seeks medical help only to reach a dead end. Her only glimmer of hope is a priest who requests to perform an exorcism on Regan. Not only is this movie terrifying, but its special effects were also well ahead of its time. That puking scene with Regan in her bed is too much for some people.The Conjuring introduces fans to Lorraine and Ed Warren, the same paranormal investigators who examined the Amityville house. All of this is true, by the way. The Warrens are real people and the Amityville murders really happened. The first Conjuring movie summons the Warrens to the Perron house where a supernatural presence has made itself known to their five daughters. Honestly, the second Conjuring might even be scarier as it introduces the nun from Lorraine's haunted childhood. The Conjuring 3 is set for release in July of 2019, and we can't wait to see what the Warrens are up to now.Sometimes, the movies with the smallest budget make the biggest impact. Just look at The Blair Witch Project. The first Paranormal Activity started with a budget of $11,000 and earned $193 million for Paramount. No biggie. In the film, we meet young couple Katie and Micah who move into a new house in San Diego. Micah quickly learns that Katie's been keeping a big secret from him: she used to see demons as a child, one of which has come back to haunt her in adulthood. Again, no biggie. Wouldn't that be a deal breaker for some? Anyway, this demon is back with an angry vengeance.Rosemary's Baby is unlike most possession movies for a number of reasons. Firstly, the possessed individual (her baby) is never seen, so it's up to our imagination to figure out what's wrong with it. The imagery of Rosemary's reaction to finally seeing her child inside the crib is beyond disturbing (see above). Secondly, there's an underlying cult storyline as members of Rosemary's building plot to impregnate her with Satan's seed -- all while she thinks this baby is going to be her sweet bundle of joy. Nope. Wrong. Rosemary becomes increasingly isolated and sickly carrying a demon baby. The diabolical truth is revealed only after Rosemary gives birth.Okay, now this is where things get confusing. Some viewers believe Insidious and The Conjuring are tied. You'll be able to guess why in a second. After Josh and Renai Lambert's son falls into an inexplicable coma, they search for answers in the paranormal world. They begin seeing dark shadows and hearing noises on the baby monitor. So, they call over Josh's mother, Lorraine (possibly from The Conjuring?) and a team of paranormal investigators. Leader Elisa Reiner fears their son has traveled too far into a purgatory realm called "The Further." Elise must then enter the realm herself to bring the boy back. Side note: Patrick Wilson also stars in both movies, which is confusing if there's no connection between the two.Let's be honest, both the original and remake of Evil Dead are equally terrifying. We really can't pick which is better. The film franchise introduces us to Ashley "Ash" Williams and his group of friends who hike into the woods for an overnight stay in a secluded cabin. There, they find the Necronomicon book, which is filled with ancient texts that reawaken the dead. Naturally, Ash's possé can't resist the temptation to read a page or two and inadvertently release a flood or evil. The creepiest scene of all takes place in the 2013 version when Mia gets "stuck" in a tree.Possession movies aren't exclusive to the US -- just ask Paco Plaza, the director of Veronica. This Spanish flick takes place during a solar eclipse when Veronica and her friends want to summon the spirit of Veronica's father using an Ouija board. Yeah, cause that always goes well. Veronica loses consciousness and it soon becomes clear that evil demons have possessed her. Oh, did we mention that it's inspired by true events? The rolling end credits are accompanied by pictures from the police report. Local officers reported that they saw a "situation of mystery and rarity." Analyze that any way you'd like.The true horrors of this movie lie in its backstory. Let's begin with serial killer Ronald DeFeo who murdered his father, mother, two brothers, and two sisters in their sleep. Why? Allegedly because voices told him to. Fast forward some weeks later when the Lutzs moved in, unaware of the horrors that unfolded inside their home. Like DeFeo, the Lutzs also reported hearing voices and seeing paranormal figures. It got so bad that they moved out in a whim without ever returning for their furniture or belongings. Come on, how can a movie about these events possibly be anything less than alarming?It's not a happy ending for Emily Rose. We learn that at the beginning of the film when Father Richard Moore, the Catholic priest who attempted the exorcism, is arrested and sent to court. The rest of Emily's story is told through flashbacks and the evidence provided by witnesses. The prosecution claims Emily suffered from epilepsy and psychosis to explain her erratic behavior -- elevating, speaking in tongues, bending her body in ways it shouldn't bend -- but Moore is convinced there's more to it than science. The Exorcism Of Emily Rose plays the science vs. religion card harder than any possession movie.This sequel is way better than the original. Seriously, don't bother with that one. Ouija 2: Original Of Evil takes place in 1967 Los Angeles in the home of widowed mother Alice Zander. Her youngest daughter, Doris, misses her father terribly and tries to make contact with him using an Ouija board. When will these people learn? Naturally, things don't go according to plan and the merciless spirit takes over Doris's body. Never have we laid eyes on a creepier little girl. The special effects in this movie are top notch as Doris's mouth stretches and her eyes roll in the back of her head.

Holiday season has arrived and this is the time where families get together and people are looking for love. What better way to find some inspiration in finding that love then with some romantic movies?Not all the movies on this list are pure romantic movies, some are comedy dramas with a romantic twist. Nevertheless, all of the entries contain enough heat that we don't feel bad recommending them.Here are Screen Rant's 10 Romantic Movies You Should See From 2015Click the button below to start this article in quick viewA freak accident leaves a young woman without the ability to age. Doesn't sound like a bad problem to be young forever, but Blake Lively makes you feel the struggles and sadness Adaline is going through. She's always on the run and has given up on finding love.This is a beautifully shot movie. Director Lee Toland Krieger moves does a great job of telling the through the changing styles and spectacular visuals of old and new San Francisco. It's one of those rare romantic movies where sex, violence, or bad language don't make an appearance. Even though it's fairly predictable how the story ultimately will end, the journey to it is satisfactory and filled with a genuine and sweet moments.The film's old fashion portrayal of dating is timeless. It's definitely one of the better romantic movies of the year.Chris Evan's directorial debut (yes, Captain America made a movie) is a romantic pleaser. Starring opposite Alice Eve in this tale of an unlikely chance encounter at a subway. Two strangers stranded for the night with nowhere to go embark on a journey throughout NYC.What could happen when you get two good-looking people together with nothing to do for an entire night? Of course sparks will fly, right? While the concept sounds predictable, the outcome isn't clear-cut. It's hard not to root for these two to end up together at the end, but its intriguing to see them navigate and help each other through their personal issues, all in one night.In an Oscar worthy performance by Saoirse Ronan, this romantic drama is as much about finding love as it is about finding your place in the world.Ronan plays Eilis, a young Irish woman who immigrates to Brooklyn. While the story takes place in the 1950s, it can easily be applied in today's day and age. Eilis meets a Yankee loving Italian guy who makes her start to forget about feeling like an outcast in her new country. Eilis's struggle between going back to Ireland or staying for her new man definitely pulls on the heartstrings.Just like in The Age of Adeline, Brooklyn has a great old-school feel and look to it that only makes you wish you could experience love during those times. A must-see romantic movie.After the flop that was Maleficent, Disney does everything right with the live-action version of Cinderella. A mainly British cast, lead by Lily James as Cinderella, dazzles with this refreshing take on the Disney princess.It's a wonderfully-compiled film with plenty of magical sets and costumes, but it's Cinderella that steals your heart. Prince Charming isn't as charming as his name makes him to be, though his unaware ways make him endearing. Disney can make anyone feel warm and fuzzy, but Cinderella is not only heartwarming, but also entertaining. A romantic movie for both the Disney and non-Disney lover.A story of two women who fall in love amid the controversy that follows one of them. Cate Blanchette and Rooney Mara are spectacular as the forbidden lovers. The film's story takes place in 1950s New York, which seems like a theme for romantic movies in 2015.Carol is as sensual and tense as it gets for a romantic movie. Just the mere interaction between Blanchette and Rooney's characters is romantically charged enough to convey the passion just with a few stares. It's an ambitious film by Todd Haynes that explores a romantic bond between two women during times when it was considered criminal for two people of the same-sex to engage in romantic relationships.Will Smith and Margot Robbie are expert con artists that scheme their way through life. So on the surface this doesn't look like a romance of any sorts, but it is. At the core of the movie is the relationship between Smith and Robbie's characters. It's a gender battle for supremacy with mutual attraction and love hidden beneath the surface of their relationship.Focus doesn't have to be a pure romance in order for it to be enjoyed. This is a fun and exciting movie that can be enjoyed for the action and sex appeal.There couldn't be a romantic movies list without a Nicholas Sparks movie in it. The Longest Ride is yet another Sparks novel turned into a movie. A bull rider and a NYC-bound college girl getting together? Only in a Sparks movie this can happen. Britt Robertson and Clint's boy Scott Eastwood are the only ones that can make this romance work.This film isn't a huge leap from the style of other Sparks adaptations; it actually falls in line with the others, which isn't a bad thing. How bad can it be to watch two good looking young people find love in the unlikeliest of ways? Sparks makes it happen and it's worth at least a rental for a hot date night.One of those coming-of-age movies where a mystery search for a girl will decide if friendship or love will prevail. Margo (Cara Delevingne) and Quentin (Nat Wolff) are a cute pair of naïve teens who run and hide from each other with the hope of love guiding Quentin to her. It's not like The Fault In Our Stars, which is what the filmmakers were going for, but it's still a romantic adventure that pleasing and entertaining not only for the teenage audience. Thanks to an excellent performance from current it-girl Cara Delevingne, this movie will probably be on a lot of teenage girls' top 10 lists this year.A rom-com with Jason Sudeikis and Alison Brie attempting to swear off any hookups in hopes to finding love. It's a portrayal of modern-day dating and relationships. The hot and cold relationship between Sudeikis and Brie is fairly authentic and relatable. Can they swear off hookups or are they so prone to them that they can't change their ways?It's an enjoyable film that didn't even crack a million bucks at the box office, but it's well worth spending a few bucks to rent it to get some laughs and perspective on modern dating.From a movie that made under a million at the box office to one that made over a $109 million more. Amy Schumer was the queen of the summer and it was mainly due to this film. A hilarious take on modern dating from a female perspective.A commitmentless lifestyle gets put to the test as Amy meets a successful sports doctor that is starting to change her thinking on dating. Plus, he's LeBron's doctor and buddy so that can't hurt his credibility. This is a must-see, and for those few people who have managed not to see the film yet, were you trapped in a cave or something? Date night? Friend night? Trainwreck is a movie for any night.This might be a controversial title, but it does at least belong in an honorable mention. Mommy porn or not, bookstores sell the book in the romance novels sections, while it's plainly clear that it's erotica. As far as the movie goes, it would be hard to recommend to anyone that this mindless soft core porn would be a date night favorite, but it still falls under the "romance" genre on Rotten Tomatoes, so it belongs right?Now if someone can recommend some acting classes for the lead actors then that might be worth a wait for the sequel.-Do you agree with the mentioned titles or are there some stellar romantic movies missing from this list? Share your thoughts and critiques in the comments section below.

Thanks to streaming services, fans of every genre can find plenty to watch outside of primetime television. If your tastes tend toward the science fiction, there are plenty of offerings, both old and new, on Hulu. You can get lost in space in a futuristic series or watch investigators try to determine what's the truth at the heart of a case. You can travel through time or see a time you hope will never come.PREVIOUSLY: Twilight Zone Super Bowl TV Spot: Jordan Peele Is the New Rod SerlingWhether you're looking for a show to get into early or a series that was on for years and will take you a while to get through, there's something for everyone.Click the button below to start this article in quick viewYes, the Arrowverse currently rules over CW's primetime television (and it's even growing), but once upon a time, there was only one superhero series part of its lineup. Smallville told the origin story of Tom Welling's Clark Kent, who would go on to become Superman.For 10 seasons, it followed him from the small town of Smallville to the big city of Metropolis and his journalistic work at the Daily Planet alongside Lois Lane. The series introduced other well-known masked heroes, including those who would go on to have their own television series, like the Green Arrow, or appear in other shows, like the Black Canary.Fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe won't want to miss this one. Marvel's Runaways fits right in with the movies and other television series available across ABC and Netflix. Those looking for the world of the Avengers or SHIELD on a (much) smaller scale need look no further.The series follows six teenagers who don't get along but have a common enemy: their evil parents. It's a Hulu original, and the entire second season was just released on the streaming service in December. In the new episodes, the teenagers are on the run and trying to hide from their parents while also trying to figure out how to stop them.What if you had the ability to change history? James Franco's Jake Epping does in this eight-episode miniseries, Hulu's 11.22.63, based on Stephen King's novel, 11/22/63. The history teacher is given the opportunity to travel back in time and prevent John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963.However, as Jake learns, changing the past is easier than said done because history wants to happen as it did. It's one of many time travel-related series, and the best part of this subgenre of science fiction is you can love them all and find something to appreciate in every one of them.Stargate SG-1 was part of the Stargate franchise and took place a year after the movie, Stargate.

The series was not only very popular, but it also received several nominations, including for Emmys.

The first three seasons of the Syfy time travel series are already available on Hulu, so you can watch the beginning of Cole and Cassie's journeys.Cole used a risky time travel machine to go back in time and try to find the origin of the deadly plague that eventually decimated the human race, and that was just the beginning. The series was loosely based on the 1995 movie with the same name.2004's Battlestar Galactica picked up where the 2003 miniseries left off, as the last surviving humans traveled on a fleet of ships led by President Laura Roslin and Commander William Adama. They were chased by Cylons that wanted to wipe out humanity, but little did they know that there could be Cylons closer than they even realized.The survivors traveled across the galaxy looking for the long-lost Earth. Earlier seasons were much stronger than the later ones, but it is still a television show worth binging, and Hulu gives you the perfect opportunity to do just that. Both the miniseries and the series are available to stream.Do you want to believe? The truth is out there. The X-Files followed FBI agents Scully and Mulder as they attempted to explain the unexplainable. The concept of the original series was simple: he believed, while she sought a scientific reason behind their cases.RELATED: The X-Files Season 11: Finale & [SPOILER] Reveal ExplainedThough the series' original nine season run ended in 2002, Fox brought it back for two additional seasons, with the season 11 finale airing in March 2018. All 11 seasons are available to stream on Hulu, so whether you're an old fan who wants to rewatch them all or a newer fan who maybe only caught the revival, you're in luck.There may have only been one season (and a follow-up movie) of Firefly, but it is easily one of the best science fiction series ever. There are fans just discovering the series now, and that's because it's available to stream on Hulu.Captain Malcolm "Mal" Reynolds led his crew on the Firefly-class spaceship Serenity, and it's likely you were able to find at least one character you loved among those on board.It was a space adventure and science fiction series that may not have been perfect but was certainly memorable, in great part because it was canceled too soon.In a way, Timeless was the little show that could, mainly, the little show that could survive cancelation — twice! Three strangers became family as they traveled through time and tried to stop the enemy that wanted to change history.NBC canceled the series after the first season, but then surprisingly took back that decision. The series returned for a second season, but then it was canceled again. However, fans were treated to a two-hour wrap-up movie in December, which not only tied all the loose threads together but also teased future life, just in case. For now, fans have to just make do with two seasons and a movie, all of which is available on Hulu.The Handmaid's Tale has been quite the success for Hulu, and it will be back for a third season soon.The dystopian drama is based on Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel and imagines a future with widespread infertility. The totalitarian Gilead becomes the government, and women become subservient to men, serving as Marthas, who work in the house, and handmaids, women who are fertile and whose sole purpose is to produce children for the man of the house and his wife. It's a bleak world, and it's a television series that has received numerous awards, for the show itself and its actors, and nominations.NEXT: What To Expect From The Handmaid's Tale Season 3

Every great film begins with a script, which must be adapted into live-action by a competent director - entrusting the right cast to do the story justice. But it's nearly impossible for a modern film to hit the big screen without some changes along the way. Oftentimes, that means tweaking or outright shedding scenes that steal attention away from the movie's larger moments and plots. But occasionally, it's the moments when actors go OFF the script that is most remembered.To offer just a small taste of the evidence, we present you with our list of the 10 Greatest Unscripted Movie Scenes.Click the button below to start this article in quick viewWhen Indiana Jones' leading lady is kidnapped in search of a holy relic in Raiders of the Lost Ark, the film's hero finds himself seriously outmatched. Instead of trying to actually fight a skilled swordsman, Jones simply pulls out his gun and drops his opponent with a single shot. The original script had called for a lengthy fight sequence, but when Harrison Ford was struck with food poisoning the night before filming, his energy was so sapped on set, he asked Steven Spielberg if he could simply shoot the man instead. The director agreed, and one of Indy's most iconic moments was born.Heath Ledger's Joker is a comic book villain for the ages, blending anarchy with dark humor in nearly every one of his scenes in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. After finding himself in police custody, he witnesses firsthand Jim Gordon's promotion to the rank of Police Commissioner. As the officers in the room applaud their colleague, the mocking, expressionless clapping from the jail cell grabs all their attention, putting the camera squarely on Joker - a chilling moment that Ledger completely improvised during the scene.Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro will forever be remembered for the chilling tale of Travis Bickle, the insomniac star of Taxi Driver - particularly Bickle's unforgettable mirror monologue centered on a single question: "You talkin' to me?" But the script only stated that Travis should begin speaking to himself in front of the mirror, without any specific details on what sort of scene to play out. The lines which followed were improvised by DeNiro entirely on the spot, with his words, raised eyebrow, and general attitude coming to define the actor for decades to come.James Cameron's sequel to Alien helped define the sci-fi genre of futuristic space marines now seen in film, TV, and even video games - but not every one of those soldiers has what it takes to bring down the franchise's Xenomorph enemies. After the first attack decimates the marines and their drop ship crash lands, the script called for Private Hudson - played by Bill Paxton - to panic, but the actor decided to add a bit of video game lingo to the line, giving the film - and the genre - one of its most beloved quotes: "Game Over, man!"The most iconic scene from Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects centers on a police line-up of the film's main cast of criminals. But writer Christopher McQuarrie came up with just a single line of dialogue for each actor to repeat, meaning it was up to the actors to shape the rest of the scene. When it came time to film, the actors sought to outdo one another, turning the scene into a mess of laughter. Even McQuarrie himself - playing the police officer on the intercom - got in on the action, asking actor Benicio del Toro to offer the line "in English please," getting an unscripted response in return.The underwater menace of Steven Spielberg's Jaws goes unseen for most of the film, finally revealing its incredible size as Police Chief Brody is throwing chum overboard to attract it, leaving him (and the audience) in shock. As Brody comes to his senses, he turns to the vessel's captain to inform him that "you're gonna need a bigger boat." The warning was improvised by actor RoyScheider during the scene, with the success of the film making it one of the most famous lines in movie history.When the heroes of Star Wars find themselves ambushed during the final act of The Empire Strikes Back, Han Solo is captured by the bounty hunter Boba Fett, planned to be frozen in carbonite and returned to Jabba the Hutt. With his character's future uncertain, Han and Leia were meant to say their goodbyes in the form of matching "I love you"s. But director Irvin Kershner felt something was missing, and told actor Harrison Ford to simply respond the way he felt his character should before shouting "Action!"What Ford came up with captured the smuggler's attitude perfectly, and offered a line no Star Wars fan will ever forget.Stanley Kubrick's tale of supernatural and psyhological terror was an instant classic, due as much to Jack Nicholson's crazed descent into madness as the novel upon which The Shining was based. When Jack turns on his family - chasing his wife and son into a bathroom - he begins chopping through the door with a fire axe, before offering a twisted version of the phrase made famous on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson: "Heeeeeeere's Johnny!" The line became a shorthand for the entire movie, despite it not appearing in Kubrick's original screenplay, improvised by Nicholson during the scene.Few cinematic psychopaths have even come close to the character of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, played by Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of The Lambs. While Hopkins proved chilling in every one of his scenes, 'Hannibal the Cannibal' cemented his legacy with a single anecdote involving a dinner of "fava beans, and a nice chianti." Hannibal's specific tastes were found in the script, but Hopkins' unsettling suckling sound effect wasn't. The actor had started making the sound to creep out his co-star Jodie Foster during rehearsals, and the director decided it was too good to leave out.Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels came up with more than a few unforgettable exchanges and physical gags as the co-leads of Dumb & Dumber, but for a scene in which a hitman discovers how the pair entertain themselves on long road trips the duo went completely off script. The back and forth wordplay, poking, and Carrey's reveal of 'the most annoying sound in the world' were all thought up on the spot with no warning given to the actor between them - meaning his reaction was genuine.So what do you think of our list?

After a fight with her fiancee, aspiring fashion designer Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) packs her things and hits the open road - leaving her apartment and engagement ring behind. However, after fueling-up at a rural gas station, Michelle's car is struck by another driver, knocking her unconscious, as her vehicle tumbles off the road. Following the accident, Michelle awakens in unfamiliar surroundings - she's handcuffed to the wall of a sparse, concrete room with no windows. In time, Michelle learns that she is the guest of a mysterious doomsday prepper, Howard Stambler (John Goodman), who claims to have stumbled upon her wrecked car, rescued her, treated her wounds, and brought her to his underground fallout shelter to recover - on the eve of an extinction-level nuclear disaster that rendered Earth's surface uninhabitable.In spite of her suspicions, and with no alternative choices, Michelle attempts to embrace life underground. Though, with no first-hand knowledge of the alleged danger up on the surface, she struggles to trust Stambler, given that her rescuer could be mistaken, completely insane, or worst of all - intentionally holding her hostage under false pretense.While many moviegoers might assume that 10 Cloverfield Lane is a sequel to the fan-favorite found-footage kaiju film Cloverfield from director Matt Reeves (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes), 10 Cloverfield Lane was actually developed, initially, as a standalone story from John Campbell and Matt Stuecken. Originally dubbed The Cellar, the film was rebranded under the Cloverfield series banner when Paramount Pictures, and Cloverfield producer J.J. Abrams, acquired the script. Ultimately, the movie's journey to the big screen doesn't undercut 10 Cloverfield Lane's quality as a standalone tale but viewers hoping for a direct sequel to Cloverfield will find sparse (at best) connective tissue within the film's world and story. That's all to say, 10 Cloverfield Lane has little in common with Cloverfield but is, nevertheless, a clever, thrilling, and downright fun movie experience.Former Totally Rad Show co-creator, and Portal: No Escape director, Dan Trachtenberg helms 10 Cloverfield Lane - and the freshman filmmaker proves himself in both storytelling and visual flare. Despite a straightforward setting, Trachtenberg injects rich world-building and cinematic flourishes that enliven what could have otherwise been a dull (albeit well-written) drama-thriller. In fact, 10 Cloverfield Lane actually benefits from Trachtenberg's inexperience - who, backed by the confidence (and money) of producer J.J. Abrams, turns wide-eyed enthusiasm into a polished mix of gripping mystery, impactful drama, lush cinematography, and clever scenes of levity.In that respect, 10 Cloverfield Lane manages to replicate the playful but frightening tone that made Cloverfield both a grounded character story and a well-realized piece of science-fiction. Given that much of Trachtenberg's success comes from smart setup and satisfying payoffs, in both the film's central mystery and clever twists along the way, viewers should avoid spoilers ahead of time. Nevertheless, the strength of 10 Cloverfield Lane isn't in answers to its mysteries - the film is most satisfying and most affecting when subverting (and toying with) viewer expectations. For that reason, audience members who have previously been frustrated by a J.J. Abrams "mystery box" TV show or movie will find the producer isn't concerned with concrete answers here either; instead, Abrams and Trachtenberg place their characters in a unique situation - and follow those characters through to a satisfying conclusion.Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman are at the center of that interplay - responsible for making loaded banter between two people in a kitchen just as absorbing as discovering what (if anything) is happening outside of the fallout shelter. Supported by sharp script work, Winstead's Michelle is a relatable entry point for the audience - one that is made even more compelling by Trachtenberg's firm control over the unfolding of 10 Cloverfield Lane and its mysteries. Michelle isn't afforded award-contender moments to pontificate but Winstead succeeds where Trachtenberg needs her most: a likable stand-in for the viewer, ensuring Michelle's fear, confusion, and relief in any given scene transfer onto 10 Cloverfield Lane's audience.Similarly, Goodman tackles a tough challenge - presenting Howard as a believable human being that falls somewhere between an eccentric but well-intentioned hero and full-on unhinged psychopath (depending on scene context). The actor moves with ease along that spectrum and Trachtenberg carefully juxtaposes Goodman's imposing physicality (especially given the small underground space) with quiet glimpses of tenderness - while exploiting the star's affable personality to punctuate fleeting glimpses at an underlying mean streak. Winstead makes for a witty protagonist but it is Goodman that ensures 10 Cloverfield Lane will keep its audience guessing.10 Cloverfield Lane is also playing in IMAX theaters but only the most dedicated viewers will likely find a premium ticket worthy of the added cost. Given that so much of the film takes place underground, in a confined space, Trachtenberg rarely gets an opportunity to take full advantage of IMAX format benefits.  That said, crisper sound and a bigger picture will contribute to a more immersive viewing - if for no other reason than the final act offers welcome contrast to the intimate drama and claustrophobic setting that dominate the first two-thirds of the film.10 Cloverfield Lane could be considered a distant-relative of its predecessor but the two are not directly linked - at all. For that reason, where viewers can expect certain tonal elements of the original film to resurface in Trachtenberg's movie, ticket buyers should base their interest on what is shown in the trailer - not what they might hope has been left out. Trachtenberg doesn't drive toward an earth-shattering reveal or over-arching moral, so moviegoers who want answers to every question will be left to fill in more than a few blanks (not to be mistaken as plot holes) on their own. Still, on its own terms, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a top-notch movie experience - with solid execution from a passionate freshman filmmaker. Trachtenberg has produced a taut, humorous, and often terrifying debut - one that will, without a doubt, have plenty of fans crying for another entry (be it sequel or spiritual successor) in the Cloverfield series.TRAILER10 Cloverfield Lane runs 105 minutes and is Rated PG-13 for thematic material including frightening sequences of threat with some violence, and brief language. Now playing in regular and IMAX theaters.Let us know what you thought of the film in the comment section below.

A fan-made alternate ending to 10 Cloverfield Lane gives fans the ending they deserved by removing the alien spaceship and adding in the original monster in its place. After years of waiting, J.J. Abrams and Bad Robot Productions finally delivered a Cloverfield sequel in the form of Dan Trachtenberg's 10 Cloverfield Lane. Sure, it wasn't a direct sequel to the original 2008 film, but the 2016 spiritual sequel did expand the franchise enough to set up future anthology installments down the line.Still, while people knew 10 Cloverfield Lane wasn't a direct sequel, they still hoped that the monster outside the hatch/bunker would be the original Cloverfield monster. That wasn't the case. Instead, there were alien ships circling that caused the fallout and disaster outside. And then at the end of the film, when Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) was approaching the Texas border, she heard a voice on the radio asking for help in Houston. Instead of heading towards refuge in Baton Rouge, she turned towards Houston to aid the resistance. That's when the audience sees another alien ship hovering in the middle of the storm. Though tantalizing, 10 Cloverfield Lane's ending was a bit underwhelming. But now a new video is looking to right that wrong.Related: How All The Cloverfield Movies ConnectYouTube channel ToolBrowny edited 10 Cloverfield Lane's ending to replace the alien ship with the original Cloverfield monster, thus giving fans a more natural connection to Matt Reeves' Cloverfield film. You can watch the video in the section above.With Julius Onah's The Cloverfield Paradox now out on Netflix, it appears 10 Cloverfield Lane is the outlier amongst the three films that have released so far. Cloverfield Paradox's near future story about a particle accelerator accident breaking the space-time continuum and ripping apart the dimensional barriers is what gives the Cloverfield monster (and the franchise) its origin.Because of the Shepard particle accelerator, monsters and aliens are ravaging the world across time. But people aren't interested in aliens; Cloverfield fans wanted another monster movie, that's why people clamored for Cloverfield 2 for so many years, and many still are hoping for a direct Cloverfield sequel one day. Even though 10 Cloverfield Lane doesn't present much of that monster story on-screen, the aforementioned fan-made alternate ending does tie the film's story into the Cloverfield universe much more organically than the one that was shown in the final cut.Now that 10 Cloverfield Lane and The Cloverfield Paradox are in the past (or the future?), hopefully, a more monster-esque story lies ahead with Bad Robot's forthcoming Cloverfield 4, aka Overlord, which is due out in theaters this October.More: The Cloverfield Paradox Broke J.J.

We’ve all been there before – a new movie we’ve been dying to see for years is on its way. The trailers tease what could very well be some amazing stuff, the posters and TV spots hint at something better than we could have imagined. But yet when the film finally does arrive, it doesn’t deliver in any of the ways that we had thought, hoped or needed it to.For movie lovers, heightened expectations are par for the course. The quality of every new release is anyone’s guess until it actually arrives in theaters. Up until that time, imaginations can get lead in different directions – spurned on by misleading promotional campaigns. Hollywood studios are highly skilled at enticing their audiences into theaters. Sometimes this pays off and sometimes it doesn't.Yesterday’s surprise trailer for the J.J. Abrams-produced sequel to 2008’s Cloverfield seemed to come out of nowhere and create a lot of excitement. Aside from including the name of the original in the new title and being produced by Abrams, 10 Cloverfield Lane’s credibility as an actual sequel is now being questioned by some. According to a post via Reddit, not only is 10 Cloverfield Lane NOT a sequel to Cloverfield, but it has also existed under two previous titles:"This film was originally made under the names Valencia and The Cellar for Paramounts Insurge division (a subsidiary for films made for under 5 million dollars like The Devil Inside), and when Paramount closed it down, this movie (shot and completed) was thrown out to the wind and orphaned. Paramount bought it back up and had Dan Casey and Damien Chazelle do some re-writes so that it would connect to the Cloverfield universe and they went back and did reshoots and add-ons in March 2015 in New Orleans and L.A."The post goes on to accuse Paramount of attempting a cash grab by pawning off something that was never intended to be a Cloverfield sequel in the first place. It claims that Abrams' involvement with Cloverfield only went as far as pitching the idea at Paramount, and that it was Drew Goddard and Matt Reeves who were responsible for the original film. Neither Goddard nor Reeves are involved with 10 Cloverfield Lane.In addition to all this, the post also provides links to such things as early audience reactions, test screenings and to information on the purported original script, which was called The Cellar. The poster points out that this film was shot in only 36 days, which comes off rather quick for an epic monster movie and mentions that the script is available to anyone who PM’s him/her. Furthermore, initial reactions to the test screening seem to support the claim that the movie originally had nothing to do with Cloverfield.There does seem to be a pretty convincing argument against this being an actual Cloverfield sequel, but there are some things to keep in mind here. The poster claims that this couldn’t be a sequel as it was made for a small budget of $5 million. Yes, this is a small budget, but the original’s $25 mil budget wasn’t huge either. If this film is merely taking the 'monsters attack' concept of the original, it doesn’t mean it can’t be part of the Cloverfield universe. Perhaps this franchise could be about making low budgeted, vaguely connected monster movies? And if that’s the case, what’s wrong with that?It’s also worth remembering that big budgets don’t necessarily equal good films. The original Cloverfield was not a massively budgeted affair and people loved it. All in all, perhaps it’s best to simply wait and give this project the benefit of the doubt – or at the very least, wait until more information is available before making any solid judgements.Screen Rant will keep providing info on 10 Cloverfield Lane as we get it, so be sure to keep checking back for updates.Source: Reddit

From Grindhouse to Final Destination 3 and The Thing, horror-lover Mary Elizabeth Winstead has become a storied scream queen. But her latest dive into this deadly genre might be her most compelling yet. In 10 Cloverfield Lane, the American ingénue takes the Final Girl trope into twisted new realms as she battles monsters real and extraterrestrial.A blood relative to the 2008 hit Cloverfield, 10 Cloverfield Lane explores the first film's cinematic world within the claustrophobic confines of an underground bunker. John Goodman stars as a conspiracy theorist who rules with an iron-fist over his bunker mates, a dopey but affable neighbor (John Gallagher Jr.) and an out-of-towner who's desperate to leave (Winstead). But escape could be even more complicated if captor's apocalyptic proclamations aren't all paranoia.Screen Rant sat down with Winstead in New York to discuss 10 Cloverfield Lane's unique and thrilling blend of genres, its feminist Final Girl, and what blood-relative movie she'd like its potential success to inspire.Screen Rant: So you’ve done a lot of horror movies. What, for you, do you think sets 10 Cloverfield Lane apart?Mary Elizabeth Winstead: 10 Cloverfield Lane for me, I wouldn’t really describe it as strictly horror. I think it’s kind of a blend of genres. I think, first and foremost, it’s a suspense movie, which we don’t really see a lot of anymore. It’s really about the suspense and tension and drama. There’s a lot of psychological drama as well, set against the backdrop of this bigger horror genre action, sci-fi kind of landscape. I love that it has so many elements of it. You can’t quite fit it into any one box.Screen Rant: Yeah. Watching it was really fun because I think you can’t, as a viewer, get totally comfortable because you keep realizing all these different things and you are trying to figure out, like, where am I supposed fit in at? Instead, it kind of keeps you on this level of anxiety of, like, “You don’t know what kind of movie…” It also reminded me of Doomsday Preppers. Have you ever watched that show?Mary Elizabeth Winstead: Oh, yes. I’ve caught this here and there. That’s scary.Screen Rant: Yeah. It’s a very specific mindset. And watching it I was like, “Yes. Oh, I know these people.”Mary Elizabeth Winstead: Oh, I know. And that’s the thing. He’s such a fascinating character because he’s crazy and he’s got a lot of issues, but he’s sort of right. There’s something to be said for his theories and everything. So it’s sort of like, “OK. Well, do I believe him and go along with this or do I just say this guy creeps me out and get the hell out of here?”Screen Rant: It’s also interesting because Michelle still is a competent character. So there’s this theme of this man deciding, like, “I know what’s best for you,” and then her fighting back. So there’s this feminist subtext that feels very topical right now. Was that part of the allure for you in doing the film?Mary Elizabeth Winstead: It definitely was. And it was also kind of a fine balance to walk. I didn’t want to sort of overshoot the mark with it being, “Oh, she’s going to really be terrified of this guy but then she’s going to get back at him at the end.” I didn’t want to have it be that too much. I wanted her to be strong from the get-go and not have to be hurt by him in order to find her strength in the end. So I like that she was sort of fighting back from the beginning. And they have their struggles and they are scrappy and they fight. And they have their ups and downs. But there’s not that sort of allegory that we see a lot where it’s sort of like some awful thing has to happen to her in order for her to become the strong person that she’s meant to be. She’s strong. The minute we see her she’s strong. I thought that was so cool.Screen Rant: Exactly. It was really fun as a horror viewer to watch that because she’s a final girl, but not the kind of final girl we often see. It’s really rewarding. So they’re calling this a blood relative to Cloverfield. Is there any other horror movie you would like to do a blood relative spinoff type movie with?Mary Elizabeth Winstead: Gosh. I would say…I mean my ultimate, ultimate favorite is The Shining. But it’s sort of hard to touch as well. If there was anything that could be done at that level. I don’t know it’d be a spinoff or it’d be connected, but just at that level of creepiness and artistry. I mean that’s like the height of the genre to me and something that I would want to be a part of.-10 Cloverfield Lane opens in theaters March 11, 2016.

Harry Potter may be the most famous franchise in the world. My generation grew up on them; even future generations are growing up on them, though it’s different movies and a play rather than the original seven books and the eight movie counterpart series. It’s pretty easy to see why they are so huge —the world-building, the characters... everything is magical, amazing, and a great escape from reality.But they aren’t without their controversy and one aspect of that is that when they were originally made into movies, some changes were made for the big screen that really disappointed book fans.RELATED: Fantastic Beasts: Professor McGonagall Breaks Harry Potter CanonI can kind of relate—I love those movies, but as a separate entity from the books. I’d drive myself crazy if I made too many comparisons… and here I am, about to do it anyway.Click the button below to start this article in quick view Harry, why did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?!Dumbledore had a very calm, serene personality in the books—in fact, at times it was hard to work out why he was the most powerful wizard of all time (at least, until that epic duel with Voldemort in book five). He was always a very soothing presence for the characters of the books, who felt protected whenever he was around.And yet, in the movies, there are many moments of him being downright explosive—even snapping at Harry who, in my opinion, has been through quite enough.RELATED: Harry Potter: 20 Crazy Revelations About Dumbledore That Even Potterheads Don't KnowPeeves wasn’t exactly integral to the plot in the books, but he was still a pretty big presence. In case you haven’t read the books and haven’t seen the movie—though if that applies to you, you should rectify it immediately—he was a poltergeist who haunted the halls of Hogwarts and tormented the students. He really came through in book five, though, when Umbridge was making everyone miserable, taking part in the rebellion against her.In the movies, he wasn’t even replaced, he was just cut out entirely. I can kind of understand this one since he wasn’t necessary to make anything move forward, but it still wasn’t quite the same without him.It wasn’t necessarily a change to the story much as it was a part that was omitted entirely, but not explaining the marauders’ backstory in Prisoner of Azkaban is the part that I would say is the biggest mistake.It’s important to know who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs actually were. Sure, it’s kind of dropped a little bit and then everyone moves on, but they really set the tone for the entire series. They created the map. They have a bunch of history that predates the series and sets the tone for a lot of it. In my opinion, they just didn’t get enough attention or explanation.RELATED: Harry Potter: 20 Crazy Things The Marauders Did Before Harry Was BornHonestly, this one was a bit of a fail in the books too. We’re told that Dumbledore and Grindelwald had an intense backstory, that they were very close and then what happened with Dumbledore’s sister separated them. This was changed entirely in the films, with Grindelwald essentially being presented as an earlier Voldemort. Okay. Not great, since Deathly Hallows was split into two movies and could easily have fit this in, but okay.RELATED: 10 Plot Twists That Hurt Harry Potter (And 10 That Saved It)Then J.K. Rowling announced Dumbledore was actually in love with Grindelwald… and then said she wasn’t going to include it in the Fantastic Beasts movies either.Why? It’s interesting, and it’s good representation. Why would you leave this out?!In the book, death is… pretty normal. Despite the spell itself being as magical as you’d think, Voldemort dies pretty normally—his corpse is on the floor. Same with Bellatrix.RELATED: Harry Potter: 20 Most Wicked Things Voldemort Did Before Sorcerer’s StoneIn the movie, they turn to ash. It’s weird, because it’s not done to be family-friendly—we’ve seen plenty of corpses in these movies—so why the change as to how they die? Why are they turning to ash and blowing away on our screen? Maybe they thought it’d be cinematic but to be honest, it just kind of made me cringe. It made me take the deaths a lot less seriously than I otherwise would have.It was extremely relevant to the story that Lily and Harry both had green eyes. It was why Snape hated looking at Harry. It was said constantly by so many characters that they had the same eyes. When the movies were being created, Rowling even said this was important.Radcliffe couldn’t wear contacts the whole time as they were deeply uncomfortable which, of course, is fine. But all they had to do was make sure that the actress who played Lily and Daniel Radcliffe had the same eye colour. Didn’t have to be green. Just… the same colour.What happened?They dropped the ball, of course.And by sad, I mean pathetic.His death is so poignant in the books. His own silver hand strangles him (the one given to him by Lord Voldemort), because he decides to spare Harry. And what with the entire Marauder backstory about his friendship with James, and how he betrayed him, it’s pretty relevant that he eventually spares Harry—because Harry spared him too, and Peter owes him a debt. It would have taken, what —thirty seconds more to include all of this in the movies? Sixty, max? And it would have given Wormtail a lot more depth rather than make him a comic relief Death Eater.Now, don’t get me wrong—I don’t really think the Dursleys deserved any redemption, or any forgiveness from Harry. They neglected and abused a child who didn’t deserve it, made his entire life miserable. But in the books, their final goodbye is way more emotional. Petunia can barely look at her nephew. Dudley shakes Harry’s hand and tells him that he doesn’t consider him a waste of space.That seems like a pretty low-key thing to say but when you consider Dudley’s ignorant, bullying history, it’s huge for Dudley to disagree with Vernon and stick up for Harry. They should have taken a couple of extra minutes to do this in the movie too.Ugh. Why is their chemistry so awkward on screen?Maybe it’s because of the writing. Rather than a couple of awkward shared kisses, they have so many good moments together in the books and Ginny is written to be much, much fiercer. She makes jokes about the women who have crushes on Harry, talking about his non-existent tattoos; she accepts his break-up with her when he goes off to hunt horcruxes because she knows it’s what he has to do, and she loves him.There’s none of this in the movies. She never really evolves from Ron’s awkward little sister only crushing on Harry because he’s a celebrity.RELATED: Harry Potter: 20 Things Harry And Ginny Did Between Deathly Hallows And Cursed ChildOnly dedicated book readers might have picked up on this one, or someone who went back and read the books immediately after seeing the movies, but Harry’s personality is written quite differently between the books and movies.The staples are the same—he’s courageous, he’s fierce, he’s compassionate. But in the books, he’s so much more full of life—he’s hot-headed, bad-tempered, and sarcastic. His personality in the books just makes him more amusing and so much more human. We can relate to his faults as much as we can admire his strengths.Never forget: there’s no need to call me sir, Professor.

Wonder Woman is an iconic superhero, who ranks right up there with Superman and Batman in terms of name recognition. And after being sidelined by her male counterparts for years, it's a particularly great time for Wonder Woman now that DC has decided to give one of the first female superheroes her own film in 2017, starring Gal Gadot. In the lead up to her big debut, she's also set to make an appearance in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice next year, which will mark the first time the trinity has appeared together on the big screen.But while everyone's heard of Wonder Woman, many people don't know that she was born Princess Diana of Themyscira. Unlike Superman and Batman, she hasn't had countless movie adaptations that allowed the average movie viewer to familiarize themselves with her background and powers. Now that she's finally swooping back to the forefront of pop-culture, we've created a list of 10 Facts You Need to Know About Wonder Woman to help you prepare.Click the button below to start this article in quick viewAs one of the longest running running comic book heroes, Wonder Woman's continuity has gone through several changes over the years. For a long time, her origin story remained the same: her mother formed her out of clay and she was brought to life by the Greek gods, which meant she had no father. Wonder Woman's superpowers were a result of her blessings from the Gods, including superhuman strength from Demeter (Goddess of the Earth) and super speed from Hermes (God of Messengers).But the origin story was changed significantly when Brian Azzarello rebooted the character as part of DC’s recent New 52 relaunch. In the New 52 reboot, Wonder Woman is actually the daughter of Zeus - King of the Gods. A Batman V Superman producer has said that the DC movie universe will follow the new origin. In a comic book landscape dominated by male heroes, a consultant for DC named William Moulton Marston had an idea for a modern female superhero. The character that would become Wonder Woman was partially inspired by Marston's wife Elizabeth, along with Olive Byrne, who lived with the couple in a polyamorous relationship.Marston created the character to rival the strength of Superman, but also have all of the positive characteristics that he associated with females, such as fairness and loving of peace. He originally called her Suprema, The Wonder Woman, but her name was shortened before she made her comic book debut in All Star Comics #8 in December 1941.Wonder Woman was granted her own series in 1942, and while it was meant to appeal to both sexes, the comic books included articles and advertisements designed to appeal to a female audience. She was quickly accepted into the superhero world, even becoming the only female member of the Justice Society (a precursor to the JLA). But it wasn't all female empowerment, as she was quickly excluded from the team's battles and relegated to the team's official secretary. Men!Marston wasn't just a comic book writer and creator of Wonder Woman; he was also a psychologist, lawyer, and inventor. He is said to have invented a systolic-blood-pressure measuring apparatus, which eventually lead to the invention of the polygraph. Marston believed there was some connection between blood pressure and a person's emotions, and he believed that women were more likely to be honest.Although there isn't any evidence of a direct connection, many people believe Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth, which forces anyone ensnared within it to tell the truth, can't just be a coincidence. Some suspect it was designed to promote some of his psychological theories on emotions and truth telling.Wonder Woman hails from Paradise Island, later dubbed Themyscira, which is home to the Amazons. Her mother is Queen Hippolyta, which makes her Princess of the Amazons. Inspired by Greek mythology, the Amazons are a race of warrior woman living free from men. The story of how the Amazons came to call the island home has changed over time, with one version saying that they parted from Greece to escape the evil deeds of mankind and another saying they are the reborn souls of abused women.All of the Amazons are well-trained in combat from a young age, which makes Wonder Woman a formidable foe in a fight thanks to her combination of combat skills and god-like powers. At one point, Batman considered Diana to be one of the best melee fighters on the planet.In the New 52, Diana spent a year of her childhood on the island under the guidance of Ares, God of War, further developing her skills in combat. When she refuses Ares's orders to slay the Minotaur, choosing instead to show it mercy, she loses his favor and respect. But her tutelage and history with him becomes important later, when she is forced to kill her former mentor during a conflict with her evil half-brother. In the process, she herself becomes the new War.While the extent of her powers as War hasn't been fully explored, she can telepathically control and communicate with the world's soldiers. Whether she also developed Ares's former power to raise dead soldiers for battle is still unknown.Wonder Woman is one of the strongest DC superheroes, with superhuman strength that puts her at least in the same category as Superman. She has even overpowered Supergirl, who is sometimes considered more powerful than Superman, though Wonder Woman is admittedly aided by her Amazonian warrior training. It was long thought that her silver bracelets, which were created from the remains of Zeus's shield, added to her powers since they are unbreakable and can be used offensively.But in the New 52, Wonder Woman removes her bracelets in order to fight a God, explaining that the bracelets are what actually protected her opponents from her intense power. It remains to be seen how powerful Wonder Woman is compared to other superheros without her limiting bracelets on.Wonder Woman's secret identity is Diana Prince. In the Golden Age comics, the character was originally just an army nurse who bore a striking resemblance to Wonder Woman, but Wonder Woman arranged for the real Diana Prince to meet up with her fiance in South America in exchange for her credentials, and thus an alias was born. Wonder Woman continued to work for the army as Diana Prince, quickly attaining a promotion to lieutenant in Army Intelligence.For a period in 1960's, Wonder Woman actually lost her powers and lived as Diana Prince, opening a trendy fashion boutique in New York's Greenwich Village.The initial lineup of the Justice League of America, which debuted in 1960, included only one female superhero: Wonder Woman. Also included on the team were Superman, Batman, Martian Manhunter, Flash, Green Lantern, and Aquaman. Eventually, more females joined, including Zatanna and Hawkwoman. Wonder Woman is almost always depicted as a founding member, sometimes even acting as the groups leader along with Superman and Batman.However, during one reboot, Wonder Woman was replaced with Black Canary as a founding member of the new Justice League. Wonder Woman was eventually given her founding member status back though. The latest version of the Justice League in the New 52, which drops "America" from its title, features Wonder Woman as the only female founding member once again, but Atom (Rhonda Pineda) and Elemental Women also join the team.Thanks to the success of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, almost everyone has heard of Thor's hammer, Mjolnir. On the hammer's side reads the inscription, "Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor." In Avengers: Age of Ultron, much to do is made over the fact that Thor is the only character who can lift the hammer. But you might be surprised at the number of characters who've wielded it in the comics who aren't the God of Thunder, including Wonder Woman.During the 1996 Marvel vs. DC crossover that pitted Marvel heroes against DC heroes, Wonder Woman gets the opportunity to try her hand at lifting Thor's hammer. In the comic, Thor loses control of Mjolnir during a battle with Shazam/Captain Marvel. When Wonder Woman stumbles upon it, she is deemed worthy of the power and easily able to lift it. But Wonder Woman, not wanting to give herself an unfair advantage, chooses to discard the hammer when it comes time to battle Marvel's Storm, and she ultimately loses that battle when Storm zaps her with some lightning.There have been many attempts at creating a live action Wonder Woman, most of them unsuccessful. In 1967, there was a failed TV pilot entitled Who's Afraid of Diana Prince?, which was meant to have the same campy feel as the successful Batman series of the time. In it, Linda Harrison played Wonder Woman, while her alter ego, Diana Prince, was played by Ellie Wood Walker. Then, a made-for-TV movie starring Cathy Lee Crosby hit the small screens in 1974.Just a year later, Diana would return to the small screen played by Lynda Carter for a new television show on ABC. It was cancelled after its first season, but CBS resurrected the show and kept it on for two more years. In 2011, NBC attempted to bring Wonder Woman back to television with their own television reboot. Adrianna Palicki, who now plays Mockingbird on Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., was cast as Wonder Woman, but the project was cancelled before the pilot could even air.-Those are just some facts you need to know about Wonder Woman. How much did you already know about Wonder Woman? Have we left anything important off our list? Let us know in the comments!

Super fans of the Lord of the Rings trilogy are some of the most hard-core nerds out there. Potterheads may have their encyclopedias, but Tolkienites have their universe creation stories. To them, the Hobbit trilogy was anywhere from a mildly uncomfortable romp back into the world we love, to an unbearable slog through Peter Jackson’s attempt to milk the franchise dry. People have even gone so far as to edit the Hobbit trilogy into one cohesive story that stuck to the book - and it’s pretty good!Related: Lord of the Rings TV Show Features 'Characters You Love'So with the upcoming Lord of the Rings TV series from Amazon Prime, fans are waiting with bated breath. With more than one billion dollars being thrown at this five-season spectacle, will it be as triumphant as Aragorn’s rule over the Reunited Kingdom, or will it burn like Lake Town under Smaug’s shadow? Here are ten things super fans want from the Lord of the Rings TV series.Lord of the Rings isn’t a dark and gritty story. There is drama, but the main characters always make it out ok. Sources close to set indicate that the first season will follow a young Aragorn. He was 87 by the time we saw him The Fellowship of the Ring so there is plenty of story to tell. None of it is particularly gruesome or harrowing, though, so there is no need to give it the same treatment as the recent King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and Robin Hood movies - which were both critically panned.Tolkeinites are very clear about what happened and what didn’t happen in Lord of the Rings lore. The last thing anyone wants is a cutesy scene when a young Aragorn meets Legolas’s brother. Fans are being told the first season is about a young Aragorn so they are expecting that to be the focus. According to the source material, the only familiar faces fans should be expecting are Elrond, Arwen, and Gandalf, so those should be the only ones we see. Speaking of source material...With a series that is supposed to be about The Lord of the Rings, and that starts with a season focused on the main character prior to the start of the first book, it would be smart to draw from the massive tome that is The Silmarillion. However, Amazon announced that their deal only includes the works of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and explicitly does not include The Silmarillion. This is both freeing and worrisome. The Silmarillion is less story and more fact-sheet so it could never really be adapted in a direct sense, but it provides an amazing framework that could be used as a guide. Not having the rights to it is a blow, but if the writers are able to stick to the spirit of it, then we might be ok.There are few who can fill the shoes of Sir Ian McKellan as Gandalf the Grey, and that could be a problem. Aragorn meets at least Elrond, Arwen, and Gandalf in his youth. While it’s not imperative that this happen, fans will want these meetings done right or not at all. If everyone can come back then they should bring everyone back, otherwise replacing one or more actors will cheapen the experience. Sir Ian McKellan has even offered to return for the show! If not, then a character can be influential in a scene without ever being seen.One of the biggest visual differences between The Lord of the Rings movies and the Hobbit trilogy was the shift from practical effects to CGI. While some epic set pieces need the help of a graphic artist, everything that was up close and personal in The Lord of the Rings was done with prosthetics and makeup (Gollum notwithstanding). In The Hobbit, this emphasis moved to CGI and it had a noticeably negative impact on the movie and the crew. Sir Ian McKellan famously almost quit acting altogether after hours of shooting alone, surrounded by green screens and tennis balls.PREVIOUSLY: The Hobbit: 15 Worst Changes From The Book To The MoviesWith five seasons of Lord of the Rings being announced, there is plenty of room for original, out of the box storytelling. If the source material of The Silmarillion is off the table, writers are going to come up with their own sprawling epic to fill at least fifty hours of captivating television. Whether anyone wants it or not, there will be comparisons to Game of Thrones; and as such, the story-telling will have to be interesting. Game of Thrones has set the bar high for political drama and sprawling action and The Lord of the Rings will have to match that level of intensity from time to time to be successful.Some sets in the Lord of the Rings movies are truly iconic, such as Gondor and Khazad-dûm. If the show is to return to these locations, it would be best to use the sets that were built for the movies. This is similar to wanting to see the original cast return, if they can; any set piece that gets re-imagined will inevitably be compared and contrasted and analyzed to death. May as well stick to what works and reuse the unbreachable walls of Helm’s Deep. And along those lines...The world of Middle Earth is topographically as diverse as, well, New Zealand. Rolling hills lead to dense forest next to towering mountains flanked by impenetrable marshlands. It’s a land that feels like Middle Earth through and through. Aside from making filming less expensive, a return here could take advantage of the sets that have already been built into the hills. If nothing else in the series is reused from the movies, at the very least a return to New Zealand will feel like a return home.There are many, many songs in Lord of the Rings and Hobbit books, and only a small handful made it into the films. While the vast majority of the songs that were in the books don’t contribute directly to the plot, they help flesh out the world of Middle Earth. Songs of joy and sorrow retell stories of long ago that help build the world and make it real. This truly separates the super fans from the casual. Everyone loves Richard Armitage’s rendition of “Far Over The Misty Mountain Cold”, but who could forget “I Sit Beside The Fire And Think”? Super fans know.Most fans were mostly approving of at least the Lord of the Rings movies, but across the board, everyone had the same question: Where is Tom Bombadil? The strange sing-song man and his wife, were almost entirely absent from the movies, save for a few lines given to other characters. Was he too difficult to fit into the vision of Peter Jackson? Perhaps, but a slightly omniscient being that simultaneously cares and is care-free could easily be woven into any story of Middle Earth. Not much is revealed in the books about his true nature, but many speculate that Tom is one of the Ainur, angelic beings that helped shape Middle Earth. Having him around will delight superfans, but trying to suss out his true origins will just leave them divided.

Looking for that perfect costume to wear this Halloween? Well, let the rest of your friends buy pre-made outfits based on iconic movie characters. Ghostface and Jack Sparrow have been worn to death - it's time for something original! We've got 10 characters worth dressing like this Halloween from movies released this year. You want to keep up with the times, don't you? This way, you can be on the cutting edge of what's cool in movies - instead of wearing a costume that was cool five years ago.It should be noted that our list started as more than 10 costumes, but we narrowed it down to our favorites. On the original list were ideas like the pink bridesmaid's dress from Bridesmaids and the cowboy outfit from Rango. One costume that didn't make the cut because the movie isn't out yet is simple: wrap broken mini liquor bottles around your knuckles like Liam Neeson in The Grey.Hopefully you'll agree the following list is much better, but surely we'll forget a costume or two - so feel free to share other ideas in the comments section. Keep in mind these are original ideas, unavailable at your local costume stores that moved in when Blockbuster and Borders left town.-Without further ado, check out our 10 highly recommended original costume ideas which will prove just how much of a movie buff you truly are.In no particular order, let's get started...-This one is for the ladies!There are very few options for original female movie costumes based on 2011 films.  But one costume that qualifies is Lisbeth Salander's goth get-up. The men should appreciate this one as well, since it is still light on the garment and heavy on the sex appeal. And if the lady wearing the outfit embraces Salander's sexual prowess, there won't be a disappointed Halloweener in sight.This costume is actually pretty easy to pull off as far as clothing goes. Basically, less is more. Keep it all black and try to add as many facial piercings and spiked collars and bracelets as you can. The hard part is getting the hair right. You'll have two choices here: You can either go with the weird half-cut, half-long look or the crazy mohawk (both are pictured above). Either way, if you want to truly become Lisbeth Salander this Halloween, we recommend you do so as far away from parole officers as possible.-Somebody has actually already made the "official jacket," but it isn't available for purchase until well after Halloween. So, you'll just have to make your own version of Driver's outfit, which continues to be a discussion point in movie pop culture. Gosling's jacket is with him at all times, whether he is staring deeply into the eyes of a beautiful woman or stomping a bad guy's head into mush. One note we took from the film is that the jacket does not repel blood very well (sadly).But there is more to the costume than the jacket (which you can custom make yourself if you're handy with a sewing machine). All you need to do is buy a shiny, white jacket and draw or stitch a yellow scorpion on the back. But the costume is only complete once you add a hammer, driving gloves, tight pants and slick boots. A toothpick would make for a nice touch to finish it off. This is a costume that won't be confused with anything else this Halloween and you can be sure there will be people dressing like Gosling in the film, but it won't be as overdone as girls with slutty nurse outfits.-Hats are normal. But a hat with a story is much more than that. You can't just go around wearing a Cardinals hat and call yourself Albert Pujols for Halloween. But any movie fan should make the immediate connection to The Adjustment Bureau if you walk into a room wearing a gray-toned suit and a short-brim fedora. The look was embedded into our collective consciousness with the film - and while it was not a cultural icon just via the film, a connection is inevitable.In order to complete the costume, you'll need a pinstripe white shirt with a dark tie and a gray suit. The Terence Stamp scarf is optional. If you really want to sell the costume, walk into a door and find a way to disappear. That will really make it a Halloween worth remembering for your audience. Although that could be taken the wrong way if they don't understand the film.-Jodie Foster's film was relatively low-profile, earning only $6.3 million on a $21 million budget. It may have made more money if it sold the beaver as a toy. Money aside, there is no question the Australian puppet serves as the driving force of a film that is at times comedic and other times heartbreaking. But the beaver itself is, by its nature, a costume. And it doesn't take much to play Walter Black and beaver for Halloween. Will everyone get it? Probably not. But you can enjoy trying out your Australian accent for a change.The hard part of this costume is that you'll probably have to make it yourself. Of course, there are options at online stores, but if you want it identical to the film's beaver, you should make it yourself with brown cotton if you can find some. Thankfully, emotional instability is not available for purchase.-Steven Soderbergh's Contagion made us even more uncomfortable with our surroundings and challenged audiences to take more care in their everyday activities. There's no getting around it, bacteria is everywhere. But you can prevent yourself from contacting airborne diseases with a simple face mask. If you really want to get creative here, you can make the full-body suit that Jude Law wears, but that seems highly difficult to make. Instead, keep it simple and just let those around know you're dressing up the part of Contagion.All you really need for the role is a face mask. You can get it at any store. The way to make the movie connection is apply some makeup to appear sick. If you are going all out, use plastic bags to create the biohazard suit worn by Jude Law above (LEGAL: We do NOT advice putting a plastic bag over your head).-If you want to get a good laugh you can dress up like a teen idol Justin Bieber. Kids love him and adults love to poke fun at him. Either way, he's everywhere. Hopefully your friends will get a kick out of your patronizing costume that does, in fact, have a connection to movies this year. Your edge can be to replace his trademark sunglasses with 3D glasses to suggest you went to his 3D concert movie.The photograph above shows Bieber in a red outfit, but his wide array of looks are all available as a costume idea. In order to dress as the most recognizable Bieber, you'll need a purple hoodie and a white jacket. For added effect, get a wireless headset and 3D glasses. The more purple you can find, the better. Those high-top sneakers and tight jeans will be important too. But the real key to this costume is the flippy hair. Grab a wig from a nearby store, or grow it out yourself. You really need to commit to this one and flip your hair every few minutes.Ah, but don't bail on us just because we suggested Bieber-fever - we've got another 5 ideas for you on the next page!Subscribe for the hottest movie, TV, and gaming news!*I agree to let Screen Rant send me emails.
“Henry Cavill’s been cast as Geralt.”I had just come back from a convention. On one of the days, I had cosplayed Witcher with my friends. I was already a fan, and looking forward to Netflix—but waking up and hearing that from my partner, who was scrolling through his phone was… bizarre, and I was instantly wary and hoping to be proven wrong when Cavill took the role on.He… hasn’t quite managed to prove me wrong yet.Netflix recently revealed the first look at Cavill’s Geralt, and my reaction is pretty much the same as the rest of the internet. It’s a weird choice.PREVIOUSLY: The Witcher First Look's Problem is JOKER, Not Cavillcavill's geralt needs▪️a better wig▪️big ass scars all over that face▪️a wig that isn't terrible▪️cat eyes idc that its only suppose to happen in darkness i want them▪️some stubble▪️hella dark eyeshadow that makes him look like he's dying▪️any wig but that oneI know what people are going to say when they read this. “Geralt in the books doesn’t have as many scars or a beard!”True. Geralt’s description isn’t really given to us in the books, so it’s pretty open to interpretation. But he does need to look rougher to give off that Geralt vibe. He’s definitely supposed to look like he’s seen some stuff even by the time this Netflix series is happening, even way before the games, but he looks all pretty and elven. Hopefully this is just a first look and Netflix can willingly listen to the shocked feedback.RELATED: The Witcher Fan Art Imagines Henry Cavill's Geralt As More GrizzledFirst look at Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia. pic.twitter.com/out3Am0JphOkay, but the quality is actually kind of similar.I wish we could see the rest of Cavill’s outfit—though maybe I would never have recovered from the horror. Still, maybe the rest of the outfit would have been better quality. This tweet is so apt because it just doesn’t look like much effort has been put into the costume. Netflix have surely given a pretty big budget for such an epic fantasy—did they use it all up on actually hiring Cavill?They seemed so weirdly excited to release this preview. It’s like they were hoping we wouldn’t realise the bad quality.PREVIOUSLY: Netflix's The Witcher Casts Ciri & Yennefer, Rounds Out Full CastAll I see with Henry Cavill's Geralt is a Viserys cosplay. pic.twitter.com/VIaZUeNnXTI love this one because the only positive thing I could find to say was, “He’d make a decent Rhaegar Targaryen.”He absolutely does look like a Targaryen. The clean-shaven pale skin, the silver hair way past his shoulders… if they had said he was going to be cast as Rhaegar in more flashbacks in the final season of Game of Thrones, I probably would have been less bothered than them saying he was going to be cast as Geralt. Though at least on that show, they’d probably have given him a somewhat realistic looking hairline.Geralt Targaryen, Father of Dragons…I'm sorry, but is Henry Cavill supposed to be Geralt.... or Raiden? pic.twitter.com/XJINEkuAjqAnother frequent comparison has been Raiden from the Mortal Kombat movies. Which makes sense. Not only does Cavill definitely look like Raiden, but those movies also looked fairly low budget.I just don’t understand why they couldn’t have splashed out more money on this look. People are scrambling to say that it may not yet be finished, which is true—but why show a cheap first look when they could have saved the big reveal to be something more impressive? Book Geralt, game Geralt, it doesn’t matter what kind of vibe Cavill is giving off—the truth is, the costume is just cheap. My cosplayer friends have way higher quality stuff, and this isn’t even their job.RELATED: The Witcher TV Show: Henry Cavill & Showrunner Respond To CastingWow Henry Cavill looks great as Geralt in the new Netflix #Witcher series! pic.twitter.com/H67jul1iPdAnother all too accurate comparison…Seriously though—he kind of does look like a younger Lucius. Age Lucius back twenty years, or put Cavill next to Draco, and you can really picture it. Even the expression on Cavill’s face in the preview makes him look like a Malfoy. It’s just weird that there are so many fantasy characters he actually kind of fits and yet, the only silver-haired fantasy character he looks nothing like is the one he’s supposed to be playing.I keep comforting myself by saying at least I’m getting a good laugh out of the tweets."Oh, cool, Henry Cavill is doing Geralt for Halloween, didn't know he was a Witcher fan.""He's in the Netflix version. That's the production costume and wig.""Ohhhhhh noooooooo"This person actually saw the costume and thought he was dressing up for Halloween. It would have made sense. Cavill has said before that he’s a big fan of The Witcher and has played the third game twice (which is quite an undertaking—it’s a long, open world game). It would have made sense if this was just a Halloween costume. But even if it had been an amateur Halloween costume, I would have been pretty critical of just how little Geralt he gives off in his vibes. So the fact this is for the official TV show is… it kills me inside a little.RELATED: Witcher 4 Should Happen With Ciri Says Geralt Voice Actor pic.twitter.com/Fy4ZMFBDN7You’ve seen bootleg costumes, right? When companies want to sell costumes of characters they don’t have the license to so they sell worse, cheaper versions? That’s what this is making fun of—suggesting Cavill’s Geralt is a bootleg version of actual Geralt.I wonder if Netflix is going to go on ignoring the bad reception or if they’re going to maturely take the criticism and alter it a little. What’s weird is, the actual author of the books is on that team as a creative influence—I can’t imagine why he didn’t ask why his witcher looks a bit too elven?Good enough. pic.twitter.com/uhGWBoCpirLegolas was the first thing my friend said to me when she saw Cavill’s costume, and it’s the one that’s stuck in my head. He looks like he’s trying to play Legolas. That’s so true. Even the wig is just a worse version of the one that Legolas wears.Legolas is the one character I can’t imagine they didn’t spot the resemblance to—and because Legolas is so iconic in fantasy already and so vastly different from Geralt, why not try to get away from that pretty elven image? Rough Geralt up a little! Give him some scars and some dark, tired, haunted eyes!RELATED: Cyberpunk 2077 is VERY Different Than The Witcher Games (And it's First-Person)Henry cavill in #TheWitcher pic.twitter.com/mIjrKflj9vThis one is, hands down, my favorite reaction because the wig is about the same quality as the one they’ve actually used.The one good thing is that Netflix has said he will grow a beard while he’s out hunting monsters and witchering, which will serve to make him look a little rougher. No, book Geralt doesn’t necessarily have a beard—he should, since I don’t know when he has time to shave, but it’s never mentioned—but the point is that Cavill needs something to make him look like that rough and tough witcher we all know and love.PREVIOUSLY: Netflix’s Witcher TV Series Will Be 8 Episodes & May Arrive In 2020when you play the witcher screen test backwards it looks like geralt is at a party listening to a man explain why the works of Woody Allen still have value pic.twitter.com/WWNsgs0Zo7Okay, okay. I’m going to stop criticizing this look and try to let Cavill have a chance at impressing me. But whether you think his Geralt costume looks great or you’re also in camp “why does it look like they bought this off Amazon?”, you can’t deny that this tweet is accurate. Watch the video played backwards—he looks like he’s doing a shot and sighing because he’s in some really bad company and listening to something he categorically does not agree with.Maybe they’ll fix up this look, or maybe this is really it—only time will tell. I at least think the casting of Triss is excellent.RELATED: The Witcher TV Show Casts Anna Shaffer As Triss Merigold

A case can be made that Hollywood hasn't had an original movie idea in decades. Instead, studios opt to play it safe and invest in franchise films rather than taking chances on original ideas. Thus, the explosion of the remakes, sequels, prequels and eventually the inevitable overhaul of a film franchise, known as the "reboot."Yes, reboots and sometimes single remakes (reboots that weren't strong enough for sequels) typically spell big box office returns and often breathe new life into an old and sometimes stale series. Nevertheless, it can also make us regret that we ever trusted filmmakers to capture the virtue and essence of the original work. For every great reboot, like J. J. Abrams' 2009 version of Star Trek, there are plenty of other reboots and remakes that just don't cut it.Here's our list of the 10 least successful reboots and remakes. Don't say we didn't warn you. Enjoy!Click the button below to start this article in quick viewGodzilla has been delighting audiences around the world for decades. However, the 1998 big budget reboot found very little love from critics. It was the third highest-grossing film worldwide that year, taking in $379 million, but the film only scored 16% on Rotten Tomatoes. Additionally, the movie won two Golden Raspberry Awards for worst supporting actress and for worst remake or sequel. It was also nominated for worst picture, worst director and worst screenplay.Initially, Godzilla was expected to break the $90 million four-day Memorial Day opening weekend record held by Jurassic Park: The Lost World, but it couldn’t hold a candle to Spielberg's film, with most critics scorning the movie for its failed attempts at humor, lack of a plot, mediocre visual effects and superficial resemblance to Jurassic Park. Nevertheless, Godzilla returned in 2014 with another reboot, which went on to gross $528 million worldwide.No one likes to see a Gus Van Sant movie on the list, but his 1998 remake of Alfred Hitchcock's classic Psycho is so bad that it earned him two Golden Raspberry Awards for worst remake or sequel and for worst director. It could be argued that the film is not a real remake, but rather a duplication, as Van Sant recreated the 1960 classic shot-for-shot, trading Anthony Perkins for Vince Vaughn as the creepy motel-owner Norman Bates and trading scream-queen Janet Leigh for Anne Heche as Marion Crane.Holding a 37% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, critic Roger Ebert said the film "demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless." Even Van Sant admitted it was an experiment that proved no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original. Later, the franchise was more successfully rebooted with the A&E series Bates Motel, which was recently renewed for a fourth season.Some people consider Tim Burton's 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes a successful reimagination of the sci-fi classic. However, with a 45% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a general consensus on the same site that "this remake of Planet of the Apes can't compare to the original," it makes this list. Likewise, awards went both ways on this one.The film was nominated for two BAFTAs, but took home awards for worst remake or sequel at the 22nd Golden Raspberry Awards. The film was the ninth highest grossing movie worldwide in 2001, taking in $362 million, but this big budget version disappointingly departs from the 1968 original with an ending that leaves much to the imagination, and the studio decided not to go ahead with the sequel that was clearly teased at the end of the film. Instead, the apes returned a decade later with the well-received Rise of the Planet of the Apes, a franchise reboot that eventually led to its own sequel, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.Some remakes aren't just bad, they're downright awful. The 2002 remake of the 1975 classic Rollerball, known for its dystopian vision of the future and gruesome depictions of the violent, titular sport, is a prime example. After American Pie hunk Chris Klein was cast in the lead role, some wondered whether he had the chops to take over from beloved character actor James Caan, who starred in the original film.As it turns out, the remake was heavily panned by the critics, garnering only a 3% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It made their list of 100 worst reviewed films of the 2000s, down at the 28th spot. The Rotten Tomatoes critic consensus? "The film was a complete flop at the box office earning almost $26 million compared to its production budget of $70 million." It's hard to argue that this remake should have ever been made at all.Can't Nicolas Cage just leave a good thing alone? Apparently not, because his 2006 remake of the 1973 cult classic The Wicker Man was not only a financial flop but a critical nightmare. This unintentionally funny film tells the story of  a police officer who travels to a remote community after the disappearance of a young child, only to become embroiled in a conspiracy by the townsfolk.Taking in a mere $38 million worldwide, it made for one of Cage’s least successful releases. Likewise the film only holds a 15% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and was nominated for 5 Golden Raspberry Awards, including worst picture, worst actor (for Cage), worst screenplay, worst remake and worst couple. If it's any consolation for star Nicolas Cage, however, his performance has become ripe for memes. It's a truly legendary example of his signature eccentric acting style.Although the 1956 The Invasion of the Body Snatchers already had a 1978 remake, that didn't deter Hollywood from re-imagining this story yet again in The Invasion. Nicole Kidman stars as a psychiatrist who, with the help of a doctor friend (Daniel Craig) discovers a mysterious epidemic that has extraterrestrial origins.Despite being helmed by the acclaimed director of Downfall, the film could only muster a measly 19% on Rotten Tomatoes, where it was slammed for being too slick and lacking suspense. The film also only grossed $40 million worldwide. In addition, the movie's happy ending doesn't sit well with fans of the two previous horror films.The classic 1984 horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street successfully launched one of the top-grossing horror franchises in America as well as giving us a substantial reason not to go to bed at night. However, this 2010 remake of the film, starring Jackie Earle Haley as the iconic Freddy Krueger, missed the mark.Though this A Nightmare on Elm Street took the number one spot with its opening weekend, it still fell short of projected earnings. It only holds a 15% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the general consensus being that it is "visually faithful, but lacking the depth and subversive twists that made the original so memorable."2010's Clash of the Titans, starring Avatar-lead Sam Worthington, was so bad that it was nominated for the worst prequel, remake, rip-off or sequel and worst eye-gouging misuse of 3D at the 31st Golden Raspberry Awards. Though the film didn't "win" any of those "awards," it only scored a 29% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the general consensus on the critic site that the film "doesn't offer enough visual thrills to offset the deficiencies of its script."Despite the lack of love for this mythological remake, it was modestly financially successful and took the top spot at the box office for two weeks in a row, which eventually lead to an even more poorly received sequel, Wrath of the Titans.1990's Total Recall, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone, is considered a classic sci-fi flick. However, 2012's Total Recall was panned by critics. Surprisingly (or maybe not), replacing Ah-nuld with Colin Farrell wasn't such a popular move. Len Wiseman's remake scored a dismal 30% rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and the general consensus on the site was "[w]hile it boasts some impressive action sequences, Total Recall lacks the intricate plotting, dry humor and fleshed out characters that made the original a sci-fi classic."Likewise the film performed poorly at the domestic box office, taking in only $58 million, but luckily it was a bigger draw overseas taking in $139 million. The film only turned a profit because of its international box office receipts.It might be a little early to say that Terminator Genisys belongs on this list, but with only $304 million worldwide (to date), the movie performed poorly enough to make Paramount Pictures reconsider their larger Terminator franchise plan. The film was supposed to re-launch the franchise into a new trilogy that centers around a new plot twist that turns John Connor, hero of previous Terminator films, into a villain.Time will tell before we know if Genisys can turn a profit but it already has "theatrical flop" written all over it. However, it's not all doom and gloom for this film, as Terminator Genisys has taken the number one spot in 28 countries around the world, despite a 26% score on Rotten Tomatoes.-Of course, reboots and remakes are nothing new. Even a classic film like The Maltese Falcon was based on another film. So it's possible we may have missed some other, worse, remakes and reboots out there. If that's the case, then feel free to let us know in the comments below!

Audiences can’t get enough of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Die-hard fans know everything there is to know about the characters, but what about the cast? Sure, everyone knows Terry Crews is an accomplished painter, but can you name his first TV appearance? Can Melissa Fumero actually dance? Who are The Pistol Shrimps and what connection do they have to Stephanie Beatriz?Related: Myers Briggs Personality Types Of Brooklyn Nine Nine CharactersHow much do you know about the men and women behind the men and women of Brooklyn’s best precinct? Here are 10 little-known facts about the cast of Brooklyn Nine-Nine.On screen, Jake Peralta and Gina Linetti, played by Andy Samberg and Chelsea Peretti, grew up together and went to the same elementary school. It turns out this is true in real life as well. In 2014, it was revealed that Chelsea not only went to school with Andy, she also claims to have had a crush on him as well. During a 2014 interview on Conan, she said "I used to call his house on like those old-timey phones that we used to have. I would call and hang up, call and hang up as some young girls do. Irritating young girls.". The above picture also surfaced, with Chelsea in the backseat and a befuddled Andy in the trunk. Here’s hoping the writers find a way to work this into the show.2009’s I Love You, Man is one of those films you look back on and realize that everyone in this movie is famous now - even Aziz Ansari makes an appearance. Looking back at Peter Klaven, played by Paul Rudd, and his groomsmen and you’ll see that Andy Samberg shares the screen with Joe Lo Truglio, who plays Lonnie in I Love You, Man and Charles Boyle in Brooklyn Nine-Nine.Joel McKinnon Miller, who plays Scully, is no stranger to roles as a cop on both the big and small screen; but his role as Officer Hole in 2002’s Friday After Next holds a special distinction. Joel plays the role on the opposite side of the law as Terry Crews, who plays Damon in the film. While they never shared the screen like Joe and Andy in the previous point, it’s fun think that they may have shaken hands backstage.1999 was a great year. Pokemon fever gripped the world and The Matrix was released in theaters. But on the small screen, an unknown Terry Crews made his small-screen debut. During its short 30 episode run, Battle Dome tried to capitalize on the popularity of its predecessor American Gladiator. In this series, Terry played T-Money, a fighter who as essentially a caricature of the late 90’s hip-hop scene. It’s possible that this is first glimpse the world got of Scary Terry.On screen, Amy Santiago, played by Melissa Fumero, is known for her inability to dance. In the real world, however, Melissa is a professionally trained dancer. In a 2016 tweet, she revealed that while in high school, she even taught ballet. As it turns out, Melissa isn’t the only secret dancer on the set of Brooklyn Nine-Nine.In 2015, Stephanie Beatriz, who plays Rosa Diaz, revealed she is a member of a dance squad called the L.A. Municipal Dance Squad. They occasionally perform during half-time of an all-female basketball rec league. This rec league is something else on its own. Many of the players are actresses, models, and writers. This league and dance squad was the source of a 2016 movie called The Pistol Shrimps that followed the rec team of the same name. It features Aubrey Plaza, from Parks and Rec, and founder Maria Blasucci from Drunk History as themselves. Hopefully, we’ll get to see Stephanie break out some of those moves on set.Andre Braugher, who plays Captain Raymond Holt, is another cast member who has previously portrayed a member of law enforcement. In the 1993 TV series Homicide: Life on the Street Andre played Frank Pembleton for six seasons. It’s very easy to see Andre’s depiction of Captain Holt as the polar opposite of his days as Frank Pembleton. In the series, Andre plays a very eccentric and hot-headed homicide detective that skirts the rules where he can to get the job done. Given a lot of hard work and practiced discipline, maybe Frank would be the kind of cop that would make Captain Holt proud one day. Also, Andre’s real-life wife Ami Brabson played his wife on the series.Everyone remembers the original Old Spice commercials featuring Isaiah Mustafa, “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like.” Those commercials were geared towards the women buying deodorant for the men in their lives. Terry, however, was for the men buying it for themselves. During a Reddit AMA in 2015, Terry Crews revealed that he and Isaiah are actually good friends. While it’s not clear if they were friends prior or became friends during shoots, they currently remain friends now that their paths have split.In Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Terry and his wife Sharon, played by Merrin Dungey, have two twin girls named Cagney and Lacey. It turns out they are named after the 1980s police procedural TV show Cagney and Lacey. In that series, the two main characters were female cops named Christine Cagney and Mary Beth Lacey. The characters made a return to the small screen in the 2018 made-for-TV-movie of the same name, but missed an opportunity to return the shout-out Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s way.Brooklyn Nine-Nine's pilot episode contains a perplexing mystery. When Captain Holt asks for Jeffords’ opinion of the squad, the Sergeant points out Scully, Hitchcock, and a woman named Daniels as being good for nothing except the morning’s coffee. To this day, no one outside of the show knows what happened to Detective Daniels. A search on IMDB reveals no information and the role is uncredited on the show.

Archie Comics is a powerhouse publishing company who has pumped out hits like their longest running publication of the same name, Archie Comics, The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and The Mighty Crusaders. Wanting to bring the beloved gang from Archie Comics back to life, The CW produced Riverdale in January of last year. Now, three seasons later, the fans of the original comics—along with new fans from the show—have come together to see what this sleepy town of Riverdale had in store for them. And while the gang's all back, intertwined in their own relationships, there are some pretty stark differences between the show and the comic books. And while some may be scratching their head at the difference in characters or storylines, that doesn't mean this show isn't entertaining, to say the least.When Riverdale was casting their four main stars, everyone was wondering who was going to be cast as everyone's favorite baddie, Veronica Lodge. So when Camila Mendes signed on, people were taken back by how much she looked like Veronica from the comics! Minus the bangs, Camila's dark hair, eyes, and gorgeous eyebrows won everyone over. However, Camila Mendes is actually Latina descent, something that comic book Veronica was not. This change is a happy one, of course, shedding light on a fresh new face and diversity. And as Miss Mendes states, "It's rare that you see Latin families being portrayed as intelligent, sophisticated, and powerful entities," which is something she's proud to bring to the table.NEXT: Riverdale Images Reveal First Look at Jughead's Mom & SisterIf you've read the Archie comics, you would know that Jughead was definitely the comedic relief in the show. With an obsession with food (mmm burgers) and a knack for being lazy, Jughead was the silly best friend who wasn't interested in dating. But in the show Riverdale, Jughead is anything but "humorous." In fact, I think the comedic light is shown on Casey Cott's Kevin Keller. In Riverdale, Jughead is still analytical (like his comic book side), but he's also dating Betty (and also had a thing with Toni). And when it comes to food... He's usually sitting in front of a cup of black coffee and that's about it.RELATED: Ranked: 10 Best Riverdale CharactersYou don't need to be a long time viewer to notice how dark Riverdale is. The entire script is written around secrets, lies, and connections we didn't even know were a thing. In the show, Alice Cooper had a love child with FP Jones? Betty's dad is a pathological liar/serial killer? Archie had a thing with his music teacher? Where does it end! However, the comics weren't this dark. The 1940s comic books were lighthearted and good for all families. The show, on the other hand, throws us in some pretty dark holes. Are there funny moments? Of course, but it's not the same tone as the comic books.RELATED: How A Riverdale & Sabrina Crossover Could Already Be Being Set UpMost non-comic book readers are aware of the connection between Betty, Archie, and Veronica. In the comics, Betty and Veronica are more like friendemys who are always after Archie. But the show tells a much different tale. While Riverdaledated started off with Betty longing for Archie, she soon found her soul's match in Jughead Jones. The two couldn't come from more different places in life but have found solace in one another. And while most people ship "Bughead," their relationship was never what it is in the comics. In fact, they never dated in the comics. Jughead was kind of asexual and was too lazy to date, while Betty always had her head in the clouds for Archie.In season one, viewers were introduced to Miss Grundy, a gorgeous music teacher who really saw "talent" in Archie Andrews. *Sure, let's call it tallent...* After "running away" from her abusive ex-husband, she called Riverdale her new home. However, no one should have trusted Miss Grundy. She definitely had more up her sleeve than viewers knew at the time. In the comic book world, though, Miss Grundy was not this flawless, young teacher. She was much older, had grey hair, and glasses. She also never had an affair with an underaged student in her class... so...Moose isn't a full-time character like the fab-four are. He really only pops up when it comes to athletics, crushing on Kevin, or dealing with his girlfriend's death. However, that doesn't mean he should go unnoticed! Moose is also a character in the comic book series, however, he was never interested in late night rendezvous with Kevin... He was completely infatuated with his girlfriend Midge. While that relationship was written in for the show, I LOVE the fact that they're adding more diversity and secret romances into the show. After all, who's to say that Moose never had one eye on Kevin in the comics?In the comics, Jason Blossom is the spoiled, rich kid with Cheryl as a twin. With expensive taste, Jason didn't just appreciate high wealth, he also enjoyed Betty. That's right, Jason was alive in the comics (before he and his sister were written off) and even took Betty out on a few dates! Don't worry though, Betty usually only did this as a way to make Archie jealous. Nevertheless, Jason was never murdered by his father and then dumped in a river on a hot summer's day like he was on the show. Granted, his mysterious death totally set up the first season, but it's interesting how different his role is in both sources.One of the best parts about The CW's Riverdale is how close Betty and Veronica. They're both extremely strong, empowered women. Although the two have different childhood backgrounds, these two go together like PB&J. And though they do get in heated arguments from time to time (mainly over Veronica's criminal parents), these two always find their way to one another. In the comics, however, these two aren't as buddy-buddy as they are in the show. Sure, they're besties, but they're also always fighting over the same guy. How can you really trust someone who would casually throw you under the bus to steal their man?Fans of Riverdale or Netflix, in general, will be familiar with The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina; a spin-off from the comics after the same name. Published by the same company that produced Archie, there are a few connections between the two. But did you know that there's another comic who was also in an adjacent universe? The Black Hood! The Black Hood has a HUGE storyline in Riverdale, but in the comic world, he was never in Archie... Instead, he had his own comic book dedicated to him. In hindsight, The CW could totally do a spinoff based around the Black Hood (how he was raised, why he does what he does, his lies to his family...). Until then, though, we'll just keep on waiting.RELATED: The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina Confirms Riverdale Shared UniverseKJ Apa's Archi Andrews is a dreamboat. Not only is he popular, a musician, and the former quarterback of the football team, but he has a loyal heart. He cares about his father deeply, is loyal as anything to girlfriend Veronica, and is even dedicated to Mr. Lodge for a short time. He's also extremely easy on the eyes, making him a total heartthrob. But in the comics? Well, let's just say comic book Archie wasn't roaming around Riverdale without his shirt on or having secret affairs with his music teacher.

Is there such a thing as too many Marvel movies? Well, the answer to that is probably, "yes". But a better way to phrase that question is, "is there such a thing as too many GOOD Marvel movies?"... and a big part of what makes a Marvel movie good has to do with Kevin Feige and the Marvel Cinematic Universe team picking the right superheroes to make movies about. Dedicated Marvel fans know that there are a lot of heroes that haven't had films dedicated to them. Some haven't even made it to the big screen as supporting characters yet.Related: Legacy Heroes Can Stop The MCU Going StaleWithout further ado, here 10 Marvel Superheroes Who Need Their Own Movies.Click the button below to start this article in quick viewMoon Knight seems to be on everybody's list when it comes to Marvel superheroes that need to get their own film. The character first appeared in 1977 and is basically Marvel's answer to Batman. He dwells in the night, has deep psychological issues, and can be particularly tough on his enemies. Since the DCEU seems to be struggling right now, Marvel could swoop in with this character to attempt to dominate the darker aspects of the superhero world on the big screen.Moon Knight is a character with superhuman abilities depending on the phases of the moon. He's not only worthy of a more gritty project such as Daredevil or Jessica Jones, but he's also prime for the Avengers franchise.Fans seem to have a deep connection with this X-Men character. It's probably because this mutant is so darn likable. Dazzler could easily star in a different type of superhero movie due to her status as an uber popular singer. Mainstream audiences haven't yet seen a superhero who both struggles with their powers and simultaneously deals with the hardships of fame.Additionally, the character of Dazzler can be altered to suit any decade of music. Marvel studios could not only play on the audience's love of nostalgia but also create and sell a soundtrack akin to that of A Star is Born or Bohemian Rhapsody.With the all-too-certain possibility of Disney taking over Fox Studios' X-Men franchise, it's hard to believe that we'll ever get to see superhero film as gritty as Logan was. That's a shame because X-23, AKA Laura Kinney, is completely worthy of her own spin-off/continuation. The dystopian universe explored in Hugh Jackman's final X-Men film was fascinating and needs to be revisited. Who better to focus on than this incredibly strong-willed and tough-as-nails mutant?X-23 got a lot of screentime in Logan, but it was really Wolverine's film. Fans seem to have adored the young character and would love to see Dafne Keen reprise her role for her very own movie.Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie was one of the highlights of 2017's Thor: Ragnarok. It's been confirmed that she survived the attack on the remaining Asgardians before the beginning of Avengers: Infinity War, but if she didn't survive Thanos' snap, she could get a prequel. In fact, it would be interesting to see how exactly she went from a valuable Asgardian warrior to a bounty hunter.There are so many things that make Valkyrie an interesting character. In a lot of ways, she comes across as the female Indiana Jones. It's easy to imagine a film where she's center stage and going off on some wild adventure across the galaxy.We all know that Silver Surfer appeared in the wreck that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, but it's time that the character got a revamp. After all, this metallic-skinned galaxy hopper would be great for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Not only could he introduce our favorite characters to new worlds, but he could also introduce them to new villains.Although Silver Surfer could be revamped in one of the Avengers, Fantastic Four, or Guardians of the Galaxy films, he is best suited for a film of his own. Origin films get tired quickly, but it could be a component in a galaxy-hopping quest that switches genres. This could introduce a whole new fanbase to the beloved and powerful character.Some might be surprised that Spider-Woman is actually a creation of the late 1970s and starred in her very own animated cartoon. Although she has a rather complicated origin story that has changed a few times over the years, Jessica Drew's Spider-Woman would be an excellent character to star in her very own film. She could easily fall into both Sony's Spider-Man content or Marvel's. However, given her link to S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA, she'd be better suited for the MCU.Spider-Woman is basically the combination of Peter Parker's Spider-Man and Natasha Romanoff's Black Widow. Not only does she have everything that Spider-Man has, but she is also a super spy and private investigator.Similar to Cable, Bishop is a time-traveling mutant who's very much linked to the X-Men's convoluted timeline. Given how Marvel and Fox need to fix their messed-up X-Men timeline, as well as link the X-Men with the Avengers franchise, Bishop could be a good tool for them.But Bishop isn't just a plot-device, he's also a particularly interesting character not dissimilar to The Terminator or characters in Timecop. Although we've seen Omar Sy play Bishop in X-Men: Days of Future Past, he was barely used and deserves his own story, even if they have to recast.The character could not only appear in a big-budget CGI-fest but also a down-to-earth, gritty crime story akin to Looper.Although the filmmakers behind the DCEU are keen to release Aquaman, some remain skeptical that it'll do well. But regardless of whether or not Aquaman is loved by audiences and critics, there's room for Marvel to make a film about their very own Atlantian, Namor.Namor is essentially the same character as Aquaman but actually predates his more famous DC counterpart. In fact, he was conceived back in 1939.There are very few differences between the two characters. Namor even has the same powers and back-story as Aquaman. But Namor's far grittier as he doesn't always play by the rules. He also had an interesting part to play in the Second World War which could work well within the MCU films.Spectrum is one of those superheroes that most fans don't know about but who would easily translate to the big screen. She first appeared all the way back in 1982 and went by the name "Monica Rambeau". She was a former New Orleans Harbor Patrol Lieutenant who received exposure to extra-dimensional energy and gained the power to turn into any form of energy along the electromagnetic spectrum. This means that she can fly at the speed of light and shoot lasers.Spectrum could be inspirational to young fans everywhere, as well as add more diversity to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Most importantly, she's an engaging and utterly powerful character that would work well on screen.Although Jessica Jones has a very successful Netflix show of her own, there's no doubt that the character would work well on the big screen. This is because she's not just a superhero, she's also a talented private detective. The Marvel Cinematic Universe likes to jump genres, therefore doing it with a detective story would make sense. And given how strong of a character Jessica is, she'd be the ideal candidate to transfer over.Jessica is also surrounded by a variety of interesting characters who would also work well on screen. The two most notable are Kilgrave and Jeri Hogarth. A P.I. story featuring all of these characters could be just what Marvel needs. Additionally, it would be a great way to honor classic films of the 1940s.Next: MCU TV Shows Will Be More Like Comics Than Movies

October was a rough one. After September 2017 -- bolstered in large part by IT -- set a new box office record, last month saw the industry take a significant nosedive, to its lowest total in a decade. Partly, the disappointing performance of Blade Runner 2049 is to blame, as is the disastrous earnings of high-profile releases like Michael Fassbender thriller The Snowman and George Clooney's latest directorial effort Suburbicon. The month's only real success stories seem to be playing into the unmitigated triumph of horror cinema this year. Both Happy Death Day and Jigsaw turned tidy profits in their opening weekends, with the former already having earned nearly $50 million as of this writing based on a reported $4.8 million production budget. But enough looking back. Let's focus on the month ahead. November is universally when the fall movie season starts to unleash its biggest tentpoles, leading into both awards season and the holidays. After all, families need something to see after they finish their Thanksgiving dinners, right? This November has no shortage of big releases heading to a theater near you, with superhero epics and broad comedies leading the way. So, before you make your shopping plans for the holidays, here are the films you'll need to make room for in your busy schedule.In other words, here are 10 films to check out in November 2017:It's fair to say that no one expected Bad Moms to be quite the monster hit that it was last summer. Based on a $20 million budget, the film -- written and directed by The Hangover writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore -- went on to earn $183 million worldwide and effectively placed stars Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn at the head of a very bankable franchise.In A Bad Moms Christmas, the titular trio reclaim the holiday season as only they can. Following the success ofR-rated, female-led ensemble comedy Girls Trip earlier this year, the chance that this sequel can duplicate its predecessor's success is more palpable than ever. Factor in the built-in appeal of a raunchy bit of holiday counter-programming, and it should be no time before Bad Moms 3 gets a green light.Check out the latest trailer for A Bad Moms Christmas.Thor: Ragnarok (Release Date: November 3)Sure, Thor and Thor: The Dark World made money. But neither film is routinely recognized among the best the Marvel Cinematic Universe has to offer. But for the third (and final?) entry in the God of Thunder's solo adventures, Marvel Studios isn't holding anything back. Nope, not even the Planet Hulk storyline that fans have waited years to see adapted on the big screen.In Thor: Ragnarok, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) returns to Asgard to find that the infamous Hela (Cate Blanchett) has decimated his homeworld. Thankfully, he finds a familiar face along his journey in Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and launches a counter-strike against Hela. With the distinct voice of director Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople) at the helm, Thor: Ragnarok is already earning critical raves for its good humor, bright-colored spectacle and pure entertainment value.Check out the latest trailer for Thor: Ragnarok.Lady Bird (Release Date: November 3)Saoirse Ronan has flirted with Oscar before with acclaimed roles in films like Atonement and Brooklyn, but if the reviews for Lady Bird are any indication, the Irish actress might finally make her way to the stage at the next ceremony. A coming of age story centering on a young woman's adventures in Northern California, the film is set to become one of this fall's most-talked-about releases.Greta Gerwig -- who earned raves for her performances in Noah Baumbach films Frances Ha and Mistress America -- writes and directs Lady Bird, which is playing in select theaters this month. Featuring a strong supporting cast that Laurie Metcalf, Tracy Letts and Lucas Hedges, the film might be worth hunting down for moviegoers looking to stay in the conversation as its release expands.Check out the latest trailer for Lady Bird.Page 2:  Justice League, Daddy's Home 2 & More

Disney Animation Studios has long been in the business of making amazing movies. Since its first feature film (Snow White) in the late 1930's, Disney Animation Studios has produced 54 films, the most recent of which is Big Hero 6, and changed the course of animation several times during the process. We all know the classics, like Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, and it's hard to make a best of Disney list without immediately thinking of Beauty and the Beast, which was the first animated film nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award. Of course, there are also the Disney-Pixar collaborations, which are widely regarded as some of the greatest films (animated or not) of all time.But that's just the tip of iceberg. There's a whole plethora of forgotten Disney Animation Studios feature films that just can't seem to get the respect they deserve. So we've reached back into the vault to pull out our list of Top 10 Underappreciated Animated Disney Films, because there is more to life than re-watching The Lion King.Click the button below to start this article in quick viewThe AristoCats follows a family of aristocratic cats who get spirited away by the butler, Edgar Balthazar (voiced by Roddy Maude-Roxby) when he learns that his mistress' fortune will go to them. More group-comedy than plot heavy action, the film relies on charming interactions between the mother cat, Duchess (Eva Gabor), her three adorable kittens, and an alley cat friend, Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), to move the story along.Walt Disney died before the film's release, but it was notably the last project that he actually approved himself. It was a critical success at the time, but it has recently come under fire for its depiction of a Siamese cat that plays the piano with chopsticks.Following an international mouse organization known as the Rescue Aid Society, The Rescuers tells the story of Miss Bianca (Eva Gabor) and her co-agent Bernard (Bob Newhart) as they set out to rescue orphan girl, Penny (Michelle Stacy) who is being held prisoner by Madame Medusa (Geraldine Page) a malevolent pawnshop owner.Wildly successful upon its theatrical release - even breaking box office records for an animated film on its opening weekend - the film earned itself a sequel in The Rescuers Down Under. Despite its humor and excellent animation, the movie has mostly faded into obscurity, overshadowed by better known Disney animated projects.The Black Cauldron, a slightly darker tale than your average Disney fare, is about an evil Horned King (voiced by John Hurt) who attempts to acquire a magical cauldron that will enable him to rule the world and the merry group who seeks to thwart him.Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film's score is still considered top-notch and the visuals are almost universally acknowledged as stunning (especially for the time). Unfortunately, The Black Cauldron was such a box office failure that even Disney seemed to forget about it - it wasn't released on home video until a full ten years after its theatrical release.One of the last films released before the "Disney Renaissance"- the era of Disney movies that produced The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast - The Great Mouse Detective is a Sherlock Holmes type story set in Victorian London - where the main characters are mice and rats.Led by the Sherlock-like Basil (Barrie Ingham) along with his partner Major Dr. David Q. Dawson (Val Bettin), The Great Mouse Detective is a funny story with a surprisingly engaging villain, Professor Ratigan (Vincent Price), and the film definitely deserves more attention that it gets these days. While only a moderate success at the box office, it was well received by critics at the time of release.Based on the classic novel of the same name, The Hunchback of Notre Dame follows Quasimodo (Tom Hulce) as he attempts to gain acceptance into society - at a time when gypsy culture was also under attack by intolerant Parisian elites (embodied by Tony Jay's wicked Judge Claude Frollo). A decidedly darker movie than many Disney classics, Quasimodo starts as a lonely and sad character, who has seemingly never known happiness.The animated cathedral is spectacular, and appropriately, there's talk of hell and damnation, culminating in the fantastic musical number, "Hellfire." While some criticized the film for taking liberties with the source material, and mature content, most critics praised the darker story and overall message of acceptance.Loosely based on Greek and Roman mythology, Hercules takes plenty of liberties with classic stories, but it still manages to produce an engaging tale. Narrated by "The Muses" (Lillias White, Cheryl Freeman, LaChanze, Roz Ryan and Vanéese Y. Thomas) the story follows Hercules (Tate Donovan) as he attempts to prevent a takeover from Hades (James Woods).The film is filled with modern-day references and jokes, and it produced several iconic Disney songs, including "I Can Go the Distance" and "Zero to Hero." Despite receiving generally positive reviews and premiering squarely within the Disney Renaissance, it has never been granted Disney Classic status.Tarzan takes a classic tale and elevates it with excellent music from Phil Collins and some of the best animation of its time. It's an adventure heavy story compared to other Disney classics, with plenty of chase scenes, parkour/skateboard-style traversal, and vine swinging through the jungle, yet still maintains the classic romantic arc between Tarzan (Tony Goldwyn) and Jane Porter (Minnie Driver).Widely regarded as the last film in the Disney Renaissance, and praised for its unique animation style, Tarzan opened at number one at the U.S. box office but hasn't been able to retain the same love as the other Disney Renaissance films.One of the most enjoyable Disney films, in terms of pure humor, The Emperor's New Groove is a buddy-comedy about a selfish and naive emperor, Emperor Kuzco (David Spade) who was turned into a llama. He then teams up with a peasant, Pacha (John Goodman) in order to become human again, learning classic Disney lessons along the way.But the film actually started its life as an epic musical entitled Kingdom of the Sun - there was even a documentary (The Sweatbox) detailing the production troubles on the movie. Despite development problems, the final film was critically very well-received, and it went on to spawn a direct-to-video sequel and a short-lived animated television series.A classic adventure story inspired by the works of Jules Verne, Atlantis is notable as Disney's first sci-fi animated film. Set at the beginning of the 20th century, the film follows a man, Milo James Thatch (Michael J. Fox), in possession of a sacred book that he believes will guide him and his crew to Atlantis.At the time, it was a drastic departure from Disney form, particularly the absence of big musical numbers. While the film received mixed reviews from critics and performed lackluster at the box office, the work in it is beautiful, including comic book influenced animation and a new language created specifically for the film.With a message of tolerance and understanding, Brother Bear is easy to love. After a human boy named Kenai (Joaquin Phoenix) kills a bear, angered spirits turn him into one - and he meets the son, Koda (Jeremy Suarez) of the bear he killed.At times heartbreaking, Brother Bear still manages to be full of adventure and vibrant animation. It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Picture when it was released but faced tough competition in (and ultimately lost to) Finding Nemo. Since that time the film has largely been ignored - except for a straight-to-video sequel in 2006.-Those are our picks for the most underappreciated animated disney films. Which ones are your favorite? Are there any we missed?

We've come to the end of 2009, so we thought we'd weigh in with a look back at the first 10 years of the 21st century in the movie world and discuss the various different "events" which shaped the decade. Obviously we can't cover absolutely everything, but sticking true to our core movie genres on the site, we're just going to concentrate on the comic-book, sci-fi, action (and so forth) types of movies and take a look at what films had the maximum impact over this decade.It's amazing to think that it's been 10 years since movies like The Matrix, American Beauty and Fight Club (to name but a few) came out in 1999 (check out our 1999 decade highlight, if you haven't already). A LOT of movies - somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000-6,000 - have been released since then. We've had the good, the bad and ugly in that time (much like every other decade, to be fair) - some we'll look back on as classics in decades to come, and others we'll probably look back on and wish we could forget about them (most video game adaptations, I'm looking at you).Behind the scenes we fervently debated which areas we should discuss in this article, and eventually we came up with 10 big ones that will hopefully bring out strong thoughts and opinions from you, our loyal readers.So without any further ado, here are the 10 events (trends, franchises - call it what you will) that we believe have shaped the decade for the types of movies we all like to revel in around here:.Judd Apatow is a producer who's actually been working since the 90s (did you know he produced the Jim Carrey dark comedy, The Cable Guy, for instance?) but it was in 2005 that we started to see the emergence of "the Apatow comedy," thanks in large part to The 40 Year Old Virgin. It was a truly hilarious film (I can't remember ever laughing that much in a theater) but also one with a lot of heart and relatability. Sure, you had your crude sex jokes, but you also had a sweet story at the center, brought to life particularly well by stars Steve Carell and Catherine Keener.The 40 Year Old Virgin was a smash hit, and it led to a slew of comedies from the Apatow camp, even if (as some people often forget) Apatow himself didn't direct most of them. Superbad, Knocked Up, Funny People, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Pineapple Express, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story - all big hits with audiences. I don't personally find all of his movies as hilarious as most people do, but there's no denying the impact his style has had on the comedy genre. For instance, you'll often hear people say, "It wasn't as funny as [insert Apatow comedy here]." And I don't see any sign of the Apatow comedy train slowing down anytime soon..In 2004 a fresh horror movie appeared on the scene called: Saw. It was a small, very low budget film that would shape the horror genre from thereafter. It effectively started a genre that we now know as "Torture-Porn." That is horror films that consist of people being tortured, and we, the audience, get to see it in all its bloody, gory, detail. It's just ironic that the original Saw has very little actual on-screen gore in it, and is actually a very smart, well-made film for what it is (it's one I still revisit from time to time).Unfortunately, it was the torture element that was latched onto by other filmmakers, and all of a sudden we were plagued with torture films; from Eli Roth's Hostel and Hostel: Part II to the Elisha Cuthbert film Captivity (which was changed half-way through, with entirely new scenes shot in order to heighten the gore factor, out of fear it wouldn't sell well to audiences otherwise - a weak box office of under $2 million opening weekend showed how bad that idea was). Saw has spawned a franchise consisting of 5 sequels already (with more coming - in 3D no less!) and is really the only torture property (with a heart of gold?) that still makes decent money. How much longer can this trend that we've seen grow wildly go on? Will it still be as prolific - if around at all - in a decade's time?Continue Reading "10 Movie Events That Shaped the Decade"

The 2000's saw the rise of the franchise reboot - that is taking an established franchise and giving it a do-over after it's been dormant for a few years. One of the biggest (and most recent) examples of this is J.J. Abrams new take on a 40-plus year old franchise, something which has given birth to everything from TV shows and movies, to whole conventions dedicated to it: Star Trek.An easy job it was NOT for director Abrams and writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman to take all that mythos and put a modern spin on it. But they did so fantastically, finding the all-important balance of respecting the original Trek material (read: don't incur the wrath of the Trekkies! :P ) but making it accessible to everyone else who were not fans of the series to begin with. It definitely worked, with Trekkies and non-Trekkies both agreeing it's one of the most fun and all-round best films of 2009.Other reboots of famous franchises mainly are in the horror camp: Friday the 13th, Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, A Nightmare on Elm Street... the list goes on and on. Although unlike Star Trek, a reboot of these franchises (it could be argued) were warranted since the current ones had long ago run out of steam. But where they differ from Star Trek is that the result wasn't worthy of the franchise name (with the possible exception of A Nightmare on Elm Street, which is still to be released). Inevitably, they've shaped the horror genre of the modern age by being the only exposure to these franchises that younger audiences will have, thus leading them to think they're THE versions of each.How wrong they are....In the very late '80s and throughout the '90s there was one superhero who dominated the movies: Batman. Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns were good, but Batman Forever showed signs of trouble and then came the travesty that was Batman & Robin, which in 1997 effectively killed the comic book movie for some time.Then, in the year 2000 came Bryan Singer's X-Men, which officially revitalized the troubled comic book movie genre (some argue it was Blade in 1998). It can't be underestimated how much of a big task that was for Singer, to take that comic book/set of characters and make it work on the big-screen, keeping it true to the source material but still making it truly it's own separate entity that non comic-book purists could enjoy.X-Men paved the way for the mainstream success of the comic-book movie. The movie made almost $300 million worldwide, signs of more successful things to come: X2: X-Men United, Spider-Man 1-3, Blade 2 and 3, Fantastic Four on and on - comic book movies had suddenly become plentiful and successful in the world of movies. Whether good (X-Men) or bad (Spider-Man 3), they became a forced to be reckoned with and are now the dominant money makers and audience pleasers around..The first decade of the 21st century brought us a couple of major returns (there are more than that, but we're only going to look at a couple): First, we finally, after almost 20 years, checked back in on our old pal Indiana Jones for a fourth adventure in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Unfortunately, it wasn't the return to greatness that we were all hoping it would be (maybe it was to SOME, but for most folks it was a huge letdown) with its silly action (not in the fun Indy way we're used to) and often lame dialogue (amongst other things).The second big return was of the legendary filmmaker James Cameron, with his 3D motion-capture sci-fi epic Avatar. It's the man's first film since the multi-Oscar winning, all-time box office juggernaut success that was Titanic. Cameron had the idea for the film over 14 years ago and he tried to make it then but was told the technology just didn't exist. So he waited. And finally, around about the time he noticed the revolutionary work done with Gollum in LOTR, the special effects technology had caught up with him, and he could bring his other-worldly vision to vibrant, skillfully crafted life.The hype for Avatar has been monumental - it being hailed as the next big step forward in filmmaking. And if you've listened to Cameron and those closest to him and the project, it's the greatest thing since sliced bread. Fortunately, the film lived up the hype (see our review)..When comic book movies went mainstream and became successful, one thing was on the agenda for them to begin with (for the most part, anyway) - they were pure fun. They were looked at completely as their own category of movie, and you'd hear opinions such as, "It was good... for a comic book movie." However, in summer of 2005 came the movie that changed all that: Batman Begins.The Batman franchise before that (which was almost destroyed by Batman & Robin) was fun and light-hearted in many ways, but no one thought it could be anymore than that. That was until Christopher Nolan came along and breathed fresh life into not only the Batman series but comic book movies in general by getting serious... Deadly serious. Batman Begins was not just 'a good movie for a comic book movie,' but a quality movie in its own right that's still very much respected to this day.Then came its sequel in the summer of 2008, the juggernaut (in every sense of the word) that was The Dark Knight. The debate continues as to whether a lot of the buzz around the film was due to the untimely death of Heath Ledger before the film's release. But there's no doubting the impact the film had, as fanboys and critics alike hailed it as (what seemed at the time) the greatest thing to come out of the movie world since the invention of celluloid. The film went even further with the darkness that Begins introduced, by exploring such themes as chaos, mass murder (not in the campy way seen in previous comic book movies) and, if you look past the theatrics, statements about homegrown terrorism.Other such serious comic book movies include 300, 30 Days of Night and Sin City, but one I want to highlight is one from earlier this year, the adaptation of the much-loved and much-lauded graphic novel, Watchmen. Extremely violent and strictly for adults only (I doubt parents who took a risk bringing their 8-year old to see TDK would allow them to watch the Watchmen come out and play), Watchmen no doubt made an impact on those who saw it, not only as one of the most slavishly faithful adaptations from one medium to another, but as a truly "proper" film its own right.So there you have it, Screen Rant's list of 10 movie events that shaped the first decade of the 21st century. As I said at the beginning, it's impossible for us to cover everything (that's why we didn't call it THE 10 movie events :) ). I'm sure you've got a few to share that we didn't cover - and we'd love to know what they are! But what did you think of the points we DID raise? Agree? Disagree? Let us know in the comments below.Here's to another 10 years of eventful and influential goings-on in the world of movies... What would we all do without them?Header Image Source: "JasonMiller91"We've come to the end of 2009, so we thought we'd weigh in with a look back at the first 10 years of the 21st century in the movie world and discuss the various different "events" which shaped the decade. Obviously we can't cover absolutely everything, but sticking true to our niche as a site, we're just going to concentrate on comic-book, sci-fi, action (and so forth) types of movies and take a look at what films had the maximum impact in that area over the course of this decade.

Even though Avengers: Infinity War was long thought to be a May release, its move to April certainly seems to be paying off. The film is still in its opening weekend as of this writing and is already riding a wave of positive buzz and impressive box office forecasts. Still, the Marvel juggernaut was far from the only smash hit to come out last month, as director/star John Krasinski's horror-thriller A Quiet Place struck a chord with audiences. Likewise, Dwayne Johnson's giant monster movie Rampage and R-rated comedy Blockers both look likely to turn a tidy profit.This month is a bit lighter on the blockbuster, though it does feature a pair of the summer's biggest heavy-hitters. Nevertheless, moviegoers of all kinds should find something worthwhile in the weeks ahead, as the summer movie season proper finally falls upon us. Without further delay, here are the 10 films we're looking forward to in May 2018.Related: The 30 Most Anticipated Movies of 201810. Dark Crimes (Release Date: May 18)Jim Carrey made a career out of playing silly characters like Ace Ventura and The Mask, but the actor has demonstrated in the past that he has a lot more to him than just a funny bone. In the new thriller Dark Crimes (which receives a limited theatrical release this month), Carrey seems determined to remind audiences just how serious he can be.Based on a 2008 article in The New Yorker titled True Crime: A Postmodern Murder Mystery, Dark Crimes follows a detective (Carrey) who discovers a sinister secret behind a murder case. The actor is exceptionally melancholy and somber in the film, which makes director Alexandros Avranas' latest an off-the-beaten-path selection for moviegoers on the hunt for a small-scale mystery.For obvious reasons, filmmaker Ben Falcone and real-life wife Melissa McCarthy just can't stop working together. After collaborating on comedies like Tammy and The Boss (both starring McCarthy and directed by Falcone), the pair is at it again with Life of the Party, co-writing this story of a middle-aged mother who returns to college after her husband asks for a divorce.McCarthy's track record at the box office has been a bit spotty in recent years, with 2015 hit Spy her last bonafide hit. Perhaps Life of the Party can be something of a course-correction then. Supporting turns from talented people like Molly Gordon, Gillian Jacobs, Maya Rudolph and Jacki Weaver certainly offers an additional incentive to check out McCarthy's latest film.Biopics are all the rage these days, especially if they also wind up being period pieces. In that case, Mary Shelley is already ahead of the curve. Haifaa al-Mansour directs the film, which explores the romantic life of the titular author. Mary Shelley also chronicles the experiences that inspired her to write Frankenstein as well as her struggles to get the book published.Elle Fanning stars as Shelley in her latest effort to illustrate her range, following films like The Neon Demon and The Beguiled. Mary Shelley features a supporting cast that includes Douglas Booth, Bel Powley, Ben Hardy and Maisie Williams. The film arrives in select theaters this month after debuting at the Toronto International Film Festival last fall.Given the original's cult classic status, we suppose a remake of the 1987 Goldie Hawn/Kurt Russell comedy Overboard was inevitable. The setup — which sees a blue-collar worker convince a spoiled heiress that she is his wife — has that broad appeal that translates easily to a crowd-pleasing comedy, and both roles really present the opportunity to showcase two gifted performers.Related: 15 Remakes You Didn’t Know Were Coming In 2018While no one would have pegged Eugenio Derbez and Anna Faris as the right stars to bring Overboard into the new millennium, we have to give director Rob Greenberg's film credit for gender-flipping the two leads. The original film played too easily on sexist stereotypes, and while some similar problems might be present in this new version, at least it's attempting something different with its approach of the material.6. First Reformed (Release Date: May 18)Few people in Hollywood have a pedigree like Paul Schrader. The legendary screenwriter of classics like Taxi Driver and Raging Bull also has a long history as a director himself, having helmed films like American Gigolo and the Oscar-winning Affliction. Now he returns with another harrowing thriller dealing with grief, loss and intrigue and hitting limited release this month.First Reformed stars Ethan Hawke as a former military chaplain grieving the death of his son. However, his sorrowful life becomes far more complex when he meets a young woman (Amanda Seyfried) in desperate need of counseling for her husband. Early reactions to Schrader's film have been largely positive, and with that premise and talented cast, First Reformed could be a sleeper hit this month.Fans of filmmaker John Cameron Mitchell have faced a long wait since his last directorial effort, Rabbit Hole, hit theaters back in 2010. Now at last, Mitchell — best known as the director and star of 2001 cult classic Hedwig and the Angry Inch — releases his next film, How to Talk to Girls at Parties, in select theaters this month. Needless to say, the film looks just as distinctive as his other projects.Based on the Neil Gaiman short story, the film is billed as a sci-fi romantic comedy and follows an alien (Elle Fanning, in her second appearance on this month's list) who gets sidetracked while exploring Earth during a visit to a London suburb. In expanding Gaiman's original tale, How to Talk to Girls at Parties hopes to add new dimension to it. At the very least, Nicole Kidman's supporting turn should be fun.For the past two decades, Gabrielle Union has shifted from one genre to the next with impressive ease. Whether in comedic roles like Bring It On or action-heavy ones like Bad Boys II, Union never fails to bring a level of charisma to every project she takes on. But despite all the films she's appeared in, the actress has never really gotten the chance to take center stage as an action hero. Until now.In Breaking In, she plays a single mother heading to her deceased father's mansion to settle his estate, with her children in tow. When they arrive, however, they find that criminals are intent on making off with the contents of the house's vault. What follows is an action-thriller that essentially looks like a combination of Taken and Panic Room. With a star like Union at the center of it, we couldn't be more interested.Jason Reitman's career has historically been all over the map. Films like Thank You for Smoking, Up in the Air and Juno were critically lauded and remain perhaps his best works. However, his last pair of releases — Labor Day and Men, Women and Children — failed to make much of an impact. With any luck, Reitman's second collaboration with his Young Adult star Charlize Theron will be just what he needs.Tully — which features a script by Juno and Young Adult screenwriter Diablo Cody — tells the story of a struggling mother (Theron) who receives the services of a night nanny (Mackenzie Davis) as a gift from her brother. At his best, Reitman has been able to perfectly balance humor and heart to create relatable and engaging human relationships. Tully could very well be the film that gets his career back on track.2. Solo: A Star Wars Story (Release Date: May 25)When Disney bought Lucasfilm, fans were struck by not only the announcement of a new trilogy but anthology-style standalone adventures set in that iconic "galaxy far, far away." Now, Solo: A Star Wars Story — as only the second of these such installments in the franchise, following Rogue One — has to escape the shadow of Harrison Ford and the stigma of a troubled production to deliver another hit.Alden Ehrenreich (Hail, Caesar!) steps into the Millennium Falcon's cockpit as the inimitable Han Solo, but while fans are anxious to see if he can handle the character's signature wry humor and confident swagger, they are just as excited to see Donald Glover's take on a young Lando Calrissian. Between those two and a supporting cast that includes Paul Bettany, Thandie Newton, Woody Harrelson and Emilia Clarke, Solo is giving Star Wars fans plenty to look forward to this month.Once upon a time, Deadpool was a character only beloved by hardcore comic book fans or those who really, really loved X-Men: Origins — Wolverine for some reason. Then 2016 happened, and Ryan Reynolds got the chance to truly step into the role for real this time. Deadpool turned out to be the second highest-grossing R-rated film of all time and the most successful X-Men film ever made.So now that we know that an R rating is officially no longer an obstacle for superhero blockbusters in this golden age of comic book movies, where does Deadpool 2 go next? According to the marketing, the film — from director David Leitch (Atomic Blonde, John Wick) — takes the Merc with the Mouth into a team dynamic, as he creates the militant mutant group X-Force to face off against Josh Brolin's Cable. It's the actor's second consecutive Marvel antagonist role (after Thanos in Infinity War), and we can't wait.-May has a wide assortment of promising new releases in store for audiences, but of course, most eyes will fall to Solo: A Star Wars Story and Deadpool 2. Although both films are franchise installments, they each represent an ambitious approach to a beloved property. The former, of course, aims to prove that the success of Rogue One wasn't a fluke and that fans will accept new actors stepping into iconic Star Wars roles. The latter, on the other hand, looks to duplicate the phenomenal success of its predecessor and introduce X-Force and its heroes to mainstream audiences.No matter what happens, we're looking forward to all the cinematic goodness May will bring, and with any luck, the month will have a pleasant surprise or two for moviegoers.Next: Avengers: Infinity War is Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes

With Christmas Day being on a Tuesday this year, many families are gearing up for an epic holiday celebration all weekend long, leading into Christmas Eve/Day. There will be lights, Christmas music, and a whole lot of food. But with so much time to spare until old Saint-Nic arrives, there's only so much a family can do. With some time on their hands, heading to the movies as a family is the perfect way to see something new as a unit (while spending $20 on a small popcorn). From action to comedy to comic book-inspired, we've got the top 10 movies to see Christmass weekend when you have some time to kill.Kicking the weekend off right, Welcome to Marwen's opening day is on Friday, the 21st. Starring Steve Carell (Mark Hogancamp), it's based off the 2010 documentary, Marwencol. After admitting that Mark enjoys being a cross-dresser, he's attacked by a group of burly men and left for dead. Magically, he survived and is now picking up the pieces of his "new" adult life. Not being able to do some of the things he used to do, Hogancamp (Carrell) now spends his time creating mini-figurines of WWII soldiers; soldiers based off people he actually knows. The movie is a combination of real-time and Toy Story-esque shooting, making it one of the most intriguing movies to come out this Christmas.The time is now! Aquaman is officially here! Starring Jason Momoa and Amber Heard, the long-awaited movie follows how Aquaman came to be. As a member of the DC Universe, Momoa (who stars as Arthur, aka Aquaman) will give you chills as he says "I am the protector the deep" in the movie's trailer. After learning about the underwater kingdom of Atlantis, Arthur trains his entire life to become the hero Atlantis is looking for. The movie also features other big names like Nicole Kidman (Athena), Willem Dafoe (Vulko), and Patrick Wilson (King Orm), which shows how many brilliant minds are behind this James Wan film.RELATED: Aquaman Nets Almost $94 Million at Chinese Box OfficeEveryone knows BumbleBee as the adorable superhero from the Transformer's franchise; but now, he's getting a movie all on his own.

With Amy Adams acting as Dick's wife, Lynne Cheney, Steve Carell acting as Donald Rumsfeld, and Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush, this movie is quite possibly Oscar territory.

April may have been the month that The Fate of the Furious sped to an easy $1 billion (and counting) worldwide box office gross, but Dominic Toretto and his crew aside, few films managed to connect with audiences. Sure, Colossal earned rave reviews amid its limited theatrical run, but films like Free Fire fell flat, and the Emma Watson-Tom Hanks thriller The Circle debuted behind less prominent releases like How to Be a Latin Lover and Indian film Baahubali 2: The Conclusion. Thankfully, May brings a ton of promising new features to the foreground, including several hotly anticipated franchise films. The 2017 summer movie season is upon us.So, as always, here are 10 films to check out in May 2017:≡ View Article on One PageIf you even casually visit the site, then you know how much anticipation surrounds Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. The first film proved that Marvel Studios has such powerful goodwill from fans that it can take chances on riskier, more obscure titles and, in the process, transformed characters like Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Groot and Rocket Raccoon into household names.Now that these characters are so beloved, writer/director James Gunn has the task of continuing their story in a way that lives up to its predecessor while expanding the cosmic side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in fun, surprising ways. After all, this is likely our last chance to catch up with the Guardians prior to that Infinity War we keep hearing about. So here's hoping those a-holes are up to the challenge.Check out the latest trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.3 Generations (Release Date: May 5)Despite some early controversy surrounding the casting of Elle Fanning in the lead, 3 Generations looks like it will provide an engrossing tale of family and self-discovery from a transsexual perspective. The film tells the story of Ray (Fanning), a teenager who begins to pursue his true identity as a male, and The Weinstein Company campaigned heavily to secure a PG-13 rating for the film.Released to select theaters this month, 3 Generations delves into the effects Ray's decision has on his relationships with his mother (Naomi Watts) and grandmother (Susan Sarandon). It's a story that will likely resonate with many moviegoers who have thus far been severely underrepresented on the big screen and may relate to director Gaby Dellal's film.Check out the latest trailer for 3 Generations.The Lovers (Release Date: May 5)A24 has a near-flawless track record for intriguing releases, and The Lovers - which arrives in limited release this month - is no exception. From director Azazel Jacobs, the film follows a married couple (Debra Winger and Tracy Letts) who are cheating on each other but find themselves falling in love all over again.The romantic comedy offers a fresh new take on the complications of love and might serve as shrewd counter-programming to the more expensive Hollywood fare this month will bring. Following its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival last month, The Lovers is already poised to be a critical darling and could expand into more theaters if word of mouth builds.Check out the latest trailer for The Lovers.Next: King Arthur: Legend of the Sword

The year in movies that was 2017 is almost behind us. Still, these final months have brought all kinds of cinematic goodies for moviegoers of all tastes. From the high-energy spectacle of Thor: Ragnarok to the universally beloved character drama of Lady Bird, November brought many noteworthy films to the forefront. Perhaps the most talked-about release remains Justice League, with its theatrical cut perpetuating rumors of what footage was left on the cutting room floor. Then, of course, there was Disney and Pixar's latest epic, Coco, which made headlines not only for its heartfelt story but the much-maligned Frozen "short" film attached to it.So it's easy to say that December has its work cut out for it, as far as ramping up the conversation among casual moviegoers and cinephiles alike. But with several awards contenders and the insanely anticipated return to the "galaxy far, far away" entering the fray, we're confident that we'll have plenty to discuss and analyze in the weeks ahead.Related: 2018 Movies That Aren't Remakes Or SequelsWithout further delay, let's jump right into the 10 films we're looking forward to in December 2017:The Disaster Artist, The Shape of Water and I, Tonya (this page)Page 2: Star Wars: The Last Jedi, The Greatest Showman, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and All the Money in the WorldPage 3: Downsizing, Pitch Perfect 3 and Phantom ThreadThe Room is rightfully heralded as one of the best bad movies ever made. In the years since its 2003 release, writer/director/star Tommy Wiseau's bananas "drama" about how personal betrayal tears apart the life of an ordinary man has gained cult status and inspired co-star Greg Sestero to chronicle its bizarre behind-the-scenes story in a popular book a decade later.Now James Franco has brought the titular book to life in The Disaster Artist, which hits theaters this month. The film stars Franco as Wiseau and Dave Franco as Sestero, following the two of them as their friendship and collaboration brings The Room to life. Following its premiere at South by Southwest, the film has steadily gained buzz for its delicate, Ed Wood-esque handling of Wiseau and Franco's performance. For both fans of The Room and newcomers, this is a must-see.Check out the latest trailer for The Disaster Artist.The Shape of Water (Release Date: December 1)Check out any of director Guillermo del Toro's previous films, and one thing becomes crystal clear: the man really loves his monsters. Whether it's an adaptation like Hellboy or an original creation like Pan's Labyrinth, del Toro's passion for practical creature effects is palpable. The Shape of Water promises to be no exception, as it uses the connection between a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) and a sea creature (del Toro regular Doug Jones) as an allegory for forbidden love.Early on in its festival run, The Shape of Water was proclaimed to be del Toro's best film in years, thanks in large part to standout performances from Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins. In the midst of awards season, the film's prospects are only growing, with many predicting it could be the first del Toro release to break into the Best Picture and Best Director categories.Check out the latest trailer for The Shape of Water.I, Tonya (Release Date: December 8)To be fair, Margot Robbie's career has been steadily inching forward since her breakthrough role in The Wolf of Wall Street. However, her committed performance as fan-favorite Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad is perhaps the one she's best known for, as it propelled the Australian actress into the mainstream. With I, Tonya, Robbie positions herself as one of the most gifted young stars of her generation.Hitting limited release this month, the film delves deep into the real-life story of figure skater Tonya Harding and the scandal involving an attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan in 1994. Director Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl) transforms this bizarre tale into a compelling character-based dark comedy without sacrificing the emotion behind it all. Robbie and co-star Allison Janney also have earned some of the best reviews of their careers for their work here.Check out the latest trailer for I, Tonya.Page 2: Star Wars, Jumanji & More

Films, no matter what the genre, need to have high stakes in order to keep audiences invested. Sometimes, as a means of illustrating the severity of the situation, a character will die to infuse a sense of danger and dread in viewers. It can be an extremely effective tool in getting us to care more about what happens on-screen, especially if the characters are well-developed.And as sad as they may be, some character deaths are necessary evils in that they play a large role in a movie’s plot. For example, many Terminator fans were crying with John Connor when the T-800 gave his memorable thumbs up as he descended into the molten steel, but his elimination was the final step in ensuring Judgment Day never came to be.Then there are those where we reflect on what we just watched and say, “Why did so and so have to die?” realizing that even if they survived, the story would have largely stayed the same (save for a few aspects here and there). Here are Screen Rant’s 10 movie deaths we most regret, where we honor the fallen characters that we really wish would have made it out of their films alive.Spoiler alert, obviously.Click the button below to start this article in quick viewAfter graduating from the police academy, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is ready to fulfill his dream of being a cop, but his superiors have another idea. Looking to take down crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), they place Costigan undercover on Costello’s team, throwing the young officer into a terrifying situation he’s not completely ready to handle. All through the film’s running time, Costigan is consumed by paranoia and fear; he reaches the point that he’s begging for Valium to calm his nerves. Since his heart was always in the right place, it’s hard not to root for Bill as he waits for the Boston police to make their move.And finally that moment happens. Costello is taken out, and during his debriefing Costigan discovers that Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) was Frank’s rat in the police department. Instead of taking his money and running, Costigan decides he’s going to bring Sullivan to justice and arrests him. Just when he thinks he’s won, Costigan is greeted by a bullet to the head in an elevator, never tasting that life of freedom he craved. After watching him endure so much, it’s a gut-punching moment that makes our hearts sink.In a complete reversal of the character he played in his first Oscar-winning collaboration with Quentin Tarantino, Christoph Waltz gave audiences the kind-hearted, well-meaning Dr. King Schultz, who took sympathy in the slaves’ plight and wished to see them set free. A bounty hunter, he takes Django (Jamie Foxx) under his wing and shows him the ropes, giving Django the guardian and friend he never had. Schultz even fulfills his promise to Django and helps him save his wife (Kerry Washington) from the clutches of the vile Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).Candie insists that Schultz shake his hand to make the deal official, but instead Schultz shoots the slave owner to death, regretfully telling Django that he “couldn’t resist” before he too is blown away by one of Calvin’s associates. Yes, Schultz’s demise did set up the frenzied bloodbath that consumed the film’s third act, but seeing as how Django and Schultz had completed their mission, it would have been arguably a more heart-warming ending had Schultz kept his gun down and just shook a hand. We’re happy that Django was reunited with his true love, but he lost a great and noble friend in the process.One of the prevailing questions that’s asked numerous times throughout Steven Spielberg’s Oscar-winning war drama is if the mission to save one man is worth the potential loss of soldiers’ lives when Germany had still not been defeated. And the filmmaker didn’t pull any punches in searching for answers, as Miller sees a number of his men make the ultimate sacrifice as they look for John Francis Ryan (Matt Damon) so he can return home to his mother. Unfortunately for the audience, Miller was among the fallen.It’s the nature of Miller’s death that made everything so heartbreaking. Doing the “right thing” and letting German “Steamboat Willie” go free after a firefight, the former prisoner is the one who puts the fatal bullet in Miller during the film’s final battle. Knowing that the conflict at Ramelle was Miller’s ticket back home (a place he desperately wanted to go), one can’t help but wish that his fortunes were reversed and he made it out of Europe alive. We’re not necessarily saying Steamboat Willie should have been executed when he was first found (since that sequence provided nice character moments), but it would have been nice to see Miller survive.Wes Anderson’s Best Picture nominee is largely a rollicking crime caper, with the misadventures of Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and his trusted lobby boy Zero (Tony Revolori) providing moments of entertainment as they attempt to uncover the mystery surrounding Madame D’s (Tilda Swinton) murder. But it’s also a story of how the world changes in the midst of a war, with Gustave fighting for the last remnants of class and sophistication, characteristics of what is seemingly a bygone era. His determination for standing up for his values and belief systems is what comes back to prematurely end his life, in actions well after he had solved his case with Zero and moved on.Toward the end of the film, Gustave meets his demise off camera defending Zero from soldiers who wish to see his immigrant papers (threatening to arrest him). Even though we never see Gustave get shot, it’s still a sad scene, and it gives the film a melancholy ending to what was a rousing adventure to that point. In a way, Gustave’s death serves one of the movie’s themes, and illustrates that his cause was always a lost one, but seeing as that he was just sticking up for his friend in an isolated incident, we don’t see why the soldiers had to be so cruel. If only Henckels (Edward Norton) had been there.In a film populated by colorful characters like Walter (John Goodman), The Jesus (John Tuturro) and The Dude (Jeff Bridges), it’s easy to forget about poor Donnie (Steve Buscemi), the third member of The Dude’s bowling team. Never really getting a chance to have his voice be heard and always relegated to the background, Donnie is mainly inconsequential to the plot, with his primary purpose being a punching bag for Walter’s insults. Even though viewers didn’t get to know him that much, he still seemed like a harmless, friendly guy who just enjoyed life.Confronted by German nihilists still under the impression that there is money to be had at the end of the film, Dude, Walter, and Donnie have to fight for their lives after a night of bowling, and though they defeat their attackers, Donnie can’t handle the excitement. He succumbs to a heart attack, putting a dark exclamation point on an otherwise comedic misadventure that was full of laughs. Donnie didn’t do much, but the main gang still seemed incomplete without him and his absence was very noticeable. The Stranger (Sam Elliott) said he didn’t like to see Donnie go, and neither did we.Just from their banter in Speed’s opening sequence, you can tell that Jack (Keanu Reeves) and Harry (Jeff Daniels) are inseparable best buds who will always have each other’s back. It’s important that their dynamic was so well-established early on, as it made one of the film’s more stunning moments a heartbreaking one as well. After the LAPD discovers the identity of the mad bomber, Harry leads a squad to Howard Payne’s (Dennis Hopper) house, but the home has been rigged to explode and the officers are killed instantly.Audiences already had enough reasons to hate Payne that this move was just icing on the cake. Viewers certainly shared Jack’s sentiments in the moments immediately after Harry is killed, as the normally calm policeman is consumed by rage. It gives us one of Keanu’s greatest lines in an action movie, but we can’t help but wonder how the film would have played out (probably not too differently) if Harry lived. As great as it was to see Jack and Annie (Sandra Bullock) get together, one final scene of Jack and Harry celebrating finally taking down Payne would be been all the more sweet.Sailing on the maiden voyage of the Titanic should be an exciting proposition, but for Rose (Kate Winslet), it’s anything but. Destined to live her life among the stuffy upper class, she would rather commit suicide than marry Cal (Billy Zane) and go through the rest of her days disillusioned. However, fate intervenes and she meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a ball of light and energy who opens up a whole new perspective of the world for Rose to see. Even though the two are on the ship for just a short time, they’re perfect for each other and fall in love. They’re even set to run off together once the boat docks.Sadly, they never get that chance. When the ship has its fateful collision with the iceberg, many of the passengers are left fending for their lives in the harsh conditions of the Atlantic Ocean. That includes Jack, who even gives up his spot on a piece of wood so Rose can stay out of the cold water, and succumbs to hypothermia before rescue boats arrive to save them (though it's debatable if there was room for both Rose and Jack). Admittedly, the true tragedy behind Titanic would make a “lovers' walk together in the sunset” ending a bit jarring (not counting the film’s final scene), but Jack and Rose were a sweet couple who deserved each other and it was heartbreaking that their time together was so short.Beginning with The Goblet of Fire, J.K. Rowling cranked up the stakes considerably by killing off characters in the Harry Potter stories. Some were heartbreaking (Sirius Black) and others were downright shocking (Dumbledore). Then there’s the case of lovable trickster twin brother Fred Weasley (James Phelps), whose passing in the Battle of Hogwarts proved so traumatic, Potter fans started a “Fred Weasley Death Support Group” on Facebook so people all around the globe could come together and mourn.It’s easy to see why so many people were impacted by Fred’s death. Though the twins were never main characters, they were certainly among the most memorable side players in the franchise, working as the Abbott and Costello of the wizarding world with the jokes and gags they constantly played on their friends. Even when the impending doom surrounding Voldemort’s return was near, they never took themselves too seriously, illustrating the fun side of magic and how it can be truly awe-inspiring. Even though George was spared to carry the torch, it isn’t the same without Fred there to complement him. His sacrifice left a void impossible to fill.The Star Wars prequels are rather maligned, but one aspect of them that's usually praised is Darth Maul (Ray Parks), the athletic Sith apprentice who quickly became one of the franchise’s most iconic creations with his stoic, intimidating persona and master skill with a lightsaber. His screen time and lines of dialogue were brief, but he was such a commanding presence that it was hard not to feel a pang of disappointment when Obi-Wan Kenobi sliced him in half and sent him toppling to his death. Yes, Maul was revived for the Clone Wars animated series, but George Lucas cost himself a great movie villain for the last two prequels.Now, we have to point out that if Maul had lived (eliminating the need for Count Dooku to step in as Sidious’ apprentice), he may not have been the best person to unite entire systems in a political alliance against the Galactic Republic (meaning Palpatine may have had to be more hands-on), but it would have been worth it just to give Maul more time to develop. As Star Wars fans, it’s hard not to wonder what things might have been like if young Anakin’s rival was Maul instead of the elder Dooku, which would have pitted two Force users in their prime against each other and been a spectacle to behold. Maul had every right to be the prequel’s answer to Vader and his legacy is one of wasted potential instead of going down as an all-time great.All throughout Aliens, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) fights to protect the young Newt (Carrie Henn) from the xenomorphs with the courageous Hicks (Michael Biehn) never leaving her side. The only survivors (along with android Bishop) of the space marines’ voyage to LV-426, the trio seemed poised to operate as a makeshift family unit, finally free of nightmares and creatures with acid blood. But in the beginning of Alien 3, their craft crashes on Fury 161. Ripley is the only one who gets out alive, essentially rendering everything she did in the previous movie pointless, since her new companions met their bitter end anyway.The case can be made that we’re cheating a little bit because the deaths of Hicks and Newt did have some impact on the plot of Alien 3. It would have been a different movie if those characters were around, but many of its elements would have stayed the same. At the same time, their losses were harder to swallow than usual, especially considering that the main alien is introduced via dog instead of an embryo that was inside Hicks or Newt. It undercut a beloved and critically acclaimed classic that had legions of supporters, and even James Cameron expressed displeasure with the decision. Heartbreaking deaths are a vital piece of cinema, but these were more cruel than emotionally gut-punching.Not all movie deaths are created equal. While some will be of great service to the core narrative and characters, there are others that just illustrate how life is unfair and sometimes people kick the bucket for no “real” reason at all. No matter how satisfying a conclusion to a film is, the knowledge that some of our favorite characters weren’t there to see it all through gives it all a bittersweet feel.Of course, our list is not meant to be all-inclusive, so be sure to list your most heartbreaking film deaths in the comments below.

If you think fictionalized astronauts floating in space is scary (a la Gravity), then a similar tale that actually happened should be even worse. Ron Howard’s cinematic telling of the failed Apollo 13 mission serves up plenty of tension and suspense - even if you already know how thecaptivating true story ends.Making this (slightly) bearable is the fact that NASA is fully aware of the situation and their employees are hard at work to devise a way to get the astronauts home safely. Still, there are several obstacles Jim Lovell and his crew must overcome. The temperatures could freeze any of the crew to death and rising carbon dioxide levels are near-fatal. Due to the poor condition of their module, the protagonists are also unsure which systems (including the heat shield) are intact - making the reentry into Earth’s atmosphere an extremely frightening trip.The crew goes through a lot of emotions during Apollo 13 and after watching the treacherous ordeal, non-spacefarers will be happy they're on solid ground.Subscribe for the hottest movie, TV, and gaming news!*I agree to let Screen Rant send me emails.
The pop culture staple of the 1990s, NBC's award-winning sitcom Friends, is one of those shows that will always be fondly remembered, rewatched, referenced and quoted. It's been twenty-five years since the show first started in September of 1994 and yet we're still talking about it.RELATED: The 10 Highest Rated TV Shows on NetflixThere's just something about these characters, their stories, the show's fine balance of humor and emotional weight that keeps us coming back to it. Even though it ran for ten seasons, the show never had a season that was outright bad. Still, we all have our favorites, so here's our ranking of all ten seasons of Friends.Click the button below to start this article in quick viewAlright, if we have to pick the worst season there’s really no other choice but to go with season nine. The penultimate season did have its good moments. Episodes like “The One with Ross’s Inappropriate Song” where he raps “Baby Got Back” to his baby daughter, and “The One with Rachel’s Other Sister” where Christina Applegate guest-stars as Amy and causes mayhem during Monica’s Thanksgiving dinner were hilarious.However, there were some episodes, plotlines, and jokes that didn’t quite land, indicating that the show had run its course. Many fans couldn’t get behind the idea of Rachel having feelings for Joey. Plotlines like Joey not remembering if he already slept with the woman he was dating, and the whole ordeal with Ross, Rachel, Joey, and Charlie won’t make anyone’s favorites list.Next off is season one. Coincidentally, it is Lisa Kudrow’s favorite season because it was the first one. However, since it was the first one, the show hadn’t yet found its feet. Don’t get us wrong, season one makes us laugh every time we watch it. Of course, certain episodes do stand out as exceptionally funny, like the one where Chandler gets stuck in an ATM vestibule during a blackout, and the season finale where Rachel finds out that Ross is in love with her.RELATED: Friends Likely Leaving Netflix After Warner Streaming Service LaunchesOn the other hand, season one had some serious issues when it comes to characters, specifically Joey, Phoebe, and Rachel, who were a bit too stereotypical at times to actually be relatable. And let’s not forget that, at one point, Ross had a freaking pet monkey, which the show itself made fun of in later seasons.Season seven is a mixed bag. Far from being outright bad, or even having a legitimately bad episode or two, season seven was just average by Friends standards. Sure, it had its moments. Who could ever forget Ross in an Armadillo costume or Chandler’s charming smile? The two-part season finale was certainly the highlight of the season with lots of excitement, hilarious and emotional moments prior to, and during Monica and Chandler’s wedding ceremony.However, season seven also had some of the show’s least memorable episodes like “The One with All the Candy” and “The One with Ross and Monica’s Cousin”, which was pretty… weird – yea, let’s go with that word.Season two finally gave the audience what they wanted – Ross and Rachel, and then some. However, some of the best and worst moments of the season revolve around the aforementioned couple. So, let’s start with what worked. The first episode was pure Jennifer Aniston comedic gold and her line “isn’t that just kick-you-in-the-crotch spit-on-your-neck fantastic?” is nothing short of iconic.The strongest episode of the bunch has to be “The One with the Prom Video”, that is, simply put, Friends at its best. Plus, it kicked off the flashback tradition that yielded some priceless moments in future seasons. That being said, “The One with the List” stands out as one of season two’s weakest and most frustrating points. Then there's the episode with Rachel's new boyfriend, aka Ross's more annoying doppelganger Russ, which wasn't great.Now, we come to the final season of Friends, which sits comfortably in the middle of our list. Right off the bat, let’s make it clear that the finale was pretty much everything we could have wanted it to be. It made us laugh, it made us cry, and even today the mental image of six keys laid out on the kitchen counter brings tears to our eyes.RELATED: 25 Wild Details About Friends Even True Fans MissedOther episodes that stand out include “The One Where Ross is Fine”, “The One with Ross’ Tan”, and basically every moment where Ross goes absolutely bonkers. We also loved seeing more Paul Rudd, aka Mike, and “The One with Princess Consuela” is hands down the best Phoebe/Mike episode. That being said, season ten did have the worst first episode of all seasons.Season six had all kinds of great moments, both comedic and emotional. With contenders like “The One Where Ross Got High”, “The One with the Routine”, “The One with Unagi”, “The One that Could Have Been”, and of course the two-part finale with Chandler’s proposal it’s impossible to pick out a favorite episode.Furthermore, all six friends had some outstanding moments. Phoebe in the Pottery Barn episode (which is basically a course in product placement), Rachel and her unforgettable beef trifle, Joey with his “identical” twin, everything about Chandler and Monica's relationship and the proposal, and last but not least Ross attempting to deal with his third divorce. Case in point, the glorious scene where he explains his three failed marriages to three potential dates. Because you see, once you know the stories it’s not that bad.In season three, Friends really hit its stride. It’s the season that managed to break our hearts and have perfect comedic beats at the same time in “The One with the Morning After”. It’s the season that thought us that cushions are the essence of the chair and never to hide a person’s underwear as one can never know what they will deem a suitable reciprocation.RELATED: Friends: The 15 All Time Best (And 10 Worst) Episodes, Officially RankedIn season three, we also learned how to fashion a giant poking device in case we ever needed to poke a possibly dead naked guy from our balcony. It’s the season that gave us the Geller Cup, the Chick and the Duck, and, last but not least, "we were on a break” – the line that would go on to become a staple of Ross and Rachel's relationship and the show itself. And all that's just the tip of the iceberg.Other than the misguided plotline that included Joey developing feelings for Rachel, season eight was perfect. It's worth noting that, this is the only time that Friends won the Emmy for Best Comedy Series. The red sweater storyline that revealed the identity of the father of Rachel’s baby was brilliant. David Schwimmer shines again with Ross's over the top reaction to the news. Then there’s the meticulously plotted episode “The One with the Videotape” that manages to tie all the seemingly unrelated plotlines together in a tight knot.In “The One with the Baby Shower”, one of those deceptively titled episodes, we got to see the best, but sadly fake, gameshow in the history of television. While the girls were having their baby shower, the guys played Bamboozled – the craziest quiz game ever created with the most ridiculous and complex set of rules. The fact that Bamboozled never became a real thing on TV is a shame.Season four had at least one of the show’s best episodes. We are talking of course about “The One with the Embryos”. Despite what the title might suggest, Phoebe getting impregnated isn’t quite the main event here. The real action takes place in Monica and Rachel’s apartment, which they end up losing in a quiz to Joey and Chandler. The question that marked their doom: what is Chandler Bing’s job? Hint: it's not transponster.RELATED: Friends: Every Major Couple Officially RankedAnd let's not forget the other season four gems, like “The One with the Jellyfish”, “The One with the Girl from Poughkeepsie”, the two-part finale with Ross’s wedding, and of course the one where Monica, while wearing an eyepatch, gets in one of the best zingers, “Fine! Judge all you want to, but married a lesbian; left a man at the altar; fell in love with a gay ice dancer; threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire; live in a box!”Out of all ten seasons, the fifth season has the most episodes that are generally considered the best episodes of Friends. Ross mental breakdown over his second failed marriage provided a lot of comedic fodder, as did Monica and Chandler’s secret relationship. “The One with All the Thanksgivings” is widely considered the top Thanksgiving episode, and “The One in Vegas: Part 2” is one of the show’s best season finale. Then, there's the one where Ross loses his mind over his sandwich, or as he likes to call it "the only good thing going on in his life," and the one where they throw a ball around for the entire episode.Finally, there's "The One Where Everybody Finds Out", which reached new levels of hilarity and gave us one of the show's most memorable lines, “they don’t know that they know we know.” Storywise, characterwise, comedy-wise, and in every other possible aspect, season five is Friends at its absolute best.NEXT: 10 Quotes From Harry Potter All Muggles Should Live By

The best movie twists are the ones that change everything that came before it. Ones that make you want to immediately go back and rewatch the movie for clues you may have missed.Movies like this are the reason spoiler warnings were invented, so consider yourself warned. However these twists were so good that they’ve become common pop culture knowledge and required viewing for any film fan. So if you still don’t know who Luke Skywalker’s father is, we apologize in advance.Here are 10 shocking plot twists you never saw comingEmpire Strikes BackThe first Star Wars film set up one of cinema’s all time greatest villains. Not only did we see Darth Vader is willing to decimate entire planets, we also learned that he was directly responsible for the death of our hero’s father. Fans who lined up around the block to see Luke take on Vader had no idea what was in store for them.Can you imagine what would have happened if Empire Strikes Back had come out in the internet age? One of the all-time greatest movie plot twists probably would have been spoiled for millions by fanboys who had just had their minds blown. Considered by many to be the definitive Star Wars movie, Empire set the bar for franchise plot twists. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows You have to give J.K. Rowling credit for keeping a secret for seven books and seven movies. Snape was always one of the most interesting characters in the Harry Potter universe, but we had no idea how important his role would be until the story’s final instalment. Clearly never a fan of Potter’s, we never knew if the professor was a full fledged practitioner of the dark arts, or just kind of a dick. When he killed Dumbledore at the end of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,  that question seemed to have a pretty definitive answer.In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows it’s revealed that this was all part of an elaborate plan Snape and Dumbledore concocted and Snape has been helping Harry all along, it changes everything you thought you knew about the character. Acting out of an unrequited love for Harry’s mother, it’s Snape who sacrifices the most to rid the world of Voldemort. Oldboy Is there a more messed up, harder hitting twist ending than Oldboy? I don’t think so. When Dae-Su Oh finally learns the reason behind his mysterious 16 year incarceration and the strange string of events that followed, he probably wished he’d never gotten out of that hotel room. An elaborate revenge plot involving hypnosis and incest make this one of the most shocking movie endings of all time. The Force Awakens With The Force Awakens now on Blu-ray, Star Wars fans have had ample opportunity to see it. The cat’s out of the bag. Our favourite smuggler bit the dust at the hands of his own son. This development had people talking in hushed tones when the film was first released for fear of spoiling it for anyone who hadn’t seen it yet. It was the best kept secret in a film with many secrets and surprises. With much of the movie based around Solo, it felt like a proper sendoff while also setting up Kylo Ren as a heartless villain. If only Han had known that walking out onto a bridge like that never ends well in Star Wars. The Departed The ending of The Departed confused many people. The movie had so many double crosses that you’re left with a pile of rats with their tales in one big knot. Mark Wahlberg’s character seemed to be the only honest cop, until the film’s last scene when we see him take out Matt Damon’s character gangland style. While Wahlberg is still acting in the interest of the police, he’s employing the other side’s tactics to get the job done. Book of Eli The Book of Eli did an excellent of foreshadowing its twist without giving it away. As we follow Denzel Washington’s Eli through this post apocalyptic world, nobody else seems better equipped to handle its threats. More than capable of defending himself against cannibals and other enemies, it’s revealed at the end that he has been navigating these dangers without the benefit of sight. If you watch the film with this knowledge you’ll notice him listening and feeling his way through scenes as Eli takes a page out of Daredevil’s book by using his other heightened senses to survive. The Usual Suspects The Usual Suspects is about a mastermind criminal pulling the wool over a detective’s eyes, and fooling all of us in the process. Director Brian Singer crafted such an elaborate web of lies that even the most of the cast didn’t know who the real Keyser Soze was until they saw the film. Singer pulls a real cinematic magic trick by having us look one way and believe Gabriel Byrne’s Keaton had orchestrated the film’s events before revealing that the real puppet master was in front of us all along. You can’t blame Detective Dave Kujan for not suspecting the crippled Verbal Kint, Kevin Spacey’s performance was so convincing that he won an actor for his role. The Sixth Sense Sixth Sense is known for having one of the best twist endings of all time. It was so good that writer/ director M. Night Shyamalan has been trying to match it ever since with very little luck. Watching the movie now, it seems painfully obvious that Bruce Willis’s character dies in the first scene and is a ghost for the rest of the film, but seeing it for the first time in 1999 had audiences getting right back in line to find the clues they missed the first time around. Fight ClubThe first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club’s ending with someone who hasn’t seen it. The second rule of Fight Club is: expect the unexpected. This explosive, mind-bending action comedy helped the 90s go out with a bang by pitting Edward Norton’s narrator against his alter ego Tyler Durden. Once you realize the two are one in the same, it seems so illogical that revisiting the film would surely disprove this left turn, yet scrutinizing Fight Club only reveals that David Fincher knew exactly what he was doing the entire time. Shutter IslandThe name Shutter Island is an anagram for “Truth and Lies”, which is quite fitting for the story that sees Leonardo DiCaprio’s detective character Teddy Daniels investigating a patient missing from a hospital for the criminally insane. Much like Fight Club, the delusional protagonist turns out to be his own antagonist, as Daniels learns that he is in fact the missing the patient and what we’ve been watching is an elaborate fantasy the character created to deal with past trauma.Subscribe for the hottest movie, TV, and gaming news!*I agree to let Screen Rant send me emails.
The DC universe is filled with powerful characters. Whether they fall on the side of good, bad, or somewhere in between, these characters are some of the most impressive in film, television, and comic book history. Some of the most formidable individuals in the DC universe are women. And when they fall on the side of evil, they can prove to be a major hassle for even the most intimidating superheroes like Batman, Wonder Woman, or Superman.This list will delve into an assortment of impressive female villains. Each of them is strong in their own way. Some may wield all the power in the universe, while others have access to incredible intelligence or resources. Without further ado, here are 10 of the strongest female villains in the DC universe.There have been many incarnations of this classic Batman villain. In almost every case, Pamela Lilian Isley, AKA Poison Ivy, is immune to practically any poison, meaning that she has a superhuman immune system. This, matched with her chemistry skills, allows her to use toxins in ways that most people can't. She can also produce pheromones that work as a mind control power, which is particularly effective on men.In certain storylines, Poison Ivy can even mentally control all plants. This means that she can cause them to grow at any rate, come-alive, and attack her enemies. As outlandish as some of her skills sound, they have proven to be effective weapons.This DC villain is based on the arch-enemy and half-sister of Arthur and Merlin in the Arthurian Legends. Just like the witch, she's based on, Morgaine le Fey is a supreme sorceress. Her spells can control even the most powerful superheroes such as Super Man and Batman. She was even capable of transporting Wonder Woman to another dimension in order to battle her for her powers.Although the immortal Morgaine usually fights for her own desires, other times she attempts to put her son Mordred on the universal throne. Regardless of who she's battling for, she almost always proves herself to be a major obstacle for the Justice League.Although this character may have a downright silly name, as well as appear as intimidating as that bossy resident of your grandparents' nursing home, she's one of the most powerful characters in the DC universe. Yes, Granny Goodness is a formidable foe. She's an immortal cosmic deity from Apokolips who often aides Darkseid on his quest for universal domination.Goodness has almost every physical superhuman ability one can think of. This includes superhuman strength, speed, and agility. Add those skills to her being a weapons expert, an excellent tactician, and a relentless fighter, and you have one powerful villain. She can also effectively teach her skills to others, creating an army of foes for the Justice League.Lady Shiva may not have the superpowers that villains like Granny Goodness or Poison Ivy have, but she is one of the most skilled fighters in all of the DC universe. She is a mindblowing martial artist, trained in several different styles. Shiva has trained under some of the best in the world. This has allowed her to fully understand body movements, meaning that she can sense what her opponent is going to do before they do it. This gives her an incredible upper hand.Shiva is completely ruthless, which aids her as an assassin for hire. She usually comes into conflict with Black Cannery, Nightwing, and Batman. Each time, she proves to be a formidable opponent for them.When it comes to DC villains, Darkseid is pretty much the most powerful. Therefore, it's easy to claim that his daughter, Grail, is also one of the best around. After all, she's absorbed a lot of his skills by osmosis. She was also prophesied to bring great destruction on behalf of her father. In short, she's the real deal when it comes to villains.Grail doesn't have the exact array of powers as Darkseid. But the two are similar. Not only is Grail a weapons expert, but she has all the abilities of occult Amazon rituals. This allows her travel inter-dimensionally, summon her father at will, and revive others from their demise. She also has superhuman speed, agility, strength, and senses.Not all sisters get along. This is certainly the case with Starfire and her villainous sibling, Blackfire. Much like her sister, Blackfire has all of the abilities of her Tamaranian ancestry. This means she can absorb ultraviolet energy and project it at will. There's no shortage of creative and destructive ways she can emit the energy. When she absorbs it, she gives her superhuman strength, agility, speed, enhanced endurance, and stamina. Additionally, she's nearly invulnerable. Her powers may be on par with her Teen Titan sister, if not superior.Blackfire, like all Tamaranians, also has the ability to assimilate languages simply by touch. This means she can more easily manipulate those who others can't understand.Catwoman is on this list not because she has the superpowers of some of the others, but because her brains match her brawn. Not only is she an excellent fighter, but she may be one of the best tacticians in the DC universe. Catwoman can mentally outmaneuver some of the best heroes and villains, which makes her formidable as she's often out for herself. Although she's not impervious to harm.As for her physical abilities, Catwoman is a trained Ninja along with an Olympic-level gymnast. This means that she can silently evade her enemies and attack them before they know she does. Catwoman is also famous for her use of sharp claws and a bullwhip that is both a weapon and a tool to escape dire scenarios.This ghoulish Superman villain was granted superpowers from a mysterious entity known as "The Crone". Her most famous power is the supersonic blast she emits from her mouth, hence her name, Silver Banshee. The blast reduces the energy and powers of all that hear it. She's also described as a succubus, as she likes to the drain the powers of her enemies and absorbs them for herself. Each time she does this, she grows stronger.Although her greatest foe has some of the best powers in the superhero universe, she also has superhuman strength, agility, and the power of flight. This makes her a formidable foe for the Man of Steel.Talia al Ghul is one of the best opponents for The Dark Knight due to the fact that the pair loves each other. Since Talia is a master manipulator, she can easily best Batman by appealing to his heart. Additionally, Talia is one of the most connected villains on this list. Not only has she had her entire life to learn the physical and intellectual skills of her father, but she also has access to his vast network of assassins, financiers, and weapons experts.Talia, herself, is trained in almost all forms of hand-to-hand combat. In some cases, she has overcome both her father, Ra's al Ghul and Batman. Most importantly, Talia is one of the most well-educated characters in the DC universe.Sure, Enchantress in the Suicide Squad movie was a total bore, but her comic book counterpart is far more engaging. She's also one of the most impressive villains in the DC universe. Her powers are hard to define. This is because the dark magic that she wields can be manipulated in a number of ways. For example, Enchantress has the ability to teleport herself to other locations and dimensions. She also can heal herself from many injuries and walk through walls.wIn the comics, multiple heroes have attempted to defeat her. But Enchantress is capable of battling multiple characters at once and still come out on top. This is one of the reasons she's one of the strongest female villains in DC's history.

Before Joseph Gordon-Levitt was cast as John Blake in Dark Knight Rises he was scrawny teenager Cameron James.  Prior to Heath Ledger playing The Joker in The Dark Knight he was older looking high school-er Patrick Verona.  No, this isn't an article on the six degrees of separation to Batman.  I'm speaking, of course, about the popular '90s teenage comedy 10 Things I Hate About You - an updated version of William Shakespeare's comedic play "The Taming of the Shrew".Director Gil Junger, who directed both the big screen version and ABC Family TV version of 10 Things I hate About You, recently told Variety that he is moving forward with production on the sequel.  While it's still way too early to know if Julia Stiles (Bourne Identity, Bourne Ultimatum) will be making any sort of return or cameo, we do know that Junger has tabbed Hayley Atwell as his leading lady for the film. Atwell recently gained stardom as Peggy Carter in Captain America: The First Avenger.Those looking for another quirky teenage comedy should know that Junger plans on going a bit darker for this sequel. Well, maybe a lot darker.  According to Junger the sequel to 10 Things I Hate About You will have a suicidal twist to it. Re-read the previous sentence if you think you've misread. The script will feature two people whose paths cross when they head to the same place at the same time to end their lives. Junger commented on where the script goes from there:“Their chance meeting is so awkward, so raw, and so funny, they postpone their intentions and go their separate ways.”No information has been released yet on a potential release date for the sequel to 10 Things I Hate About You - nor has word leaked on who else may be starring along side Hayley Atwell. One might be wondering if Zac Efron's phone may soon be ringing. One might also be wondering why you suddenly can't get that song "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" out of your head.We'll keep you updated on the status of the 10 Things I Hate About You sequel as more news comes to light.Source: VarietySubscribe for the hottest movie, TV, and gaming news!*I agree to let Screen Rant send me emails.
With great power comes the opportunity to be other people who have great power. Over Spider-Man's storied career, Spider-Man has taken on the mantle of numerous Marvel Comics heroes and villains.RELATED: Everything Maguire, Garfield, And Holland Did Right With Spider-Man (And Everything They Did Wrong)Many of these versions exist in alternate universes or imagined "What If?" scenarios. Regardless, each time Spider-Man has shown himself capable of being as strong as another hero, or as ruthless as one of his villains.Click the button below to start this article in quick viewSpider-Man and The Lizard have been enemies since for years, dating all the way back to Amazing Spider-Man #6. At one point, Spider-Man attempted to cure Dr. Curt Connors from his Lizard persona.The method used to cure Connors was successful, but had an adverse effect on Peter Parker, turning him into the Spider-Lizard. Spider-Lizard terrorized New York for days before being cured of his affliction by Dr. Connors.In the 1998 episode "Spider Wars Part 1: I Really Really Hate Clones", Peter Parker is thrust into a world that has been devastated by Spider-Carnage. This world's version of Spider-Man fused with the Carnage symbiote, attacking and destroying anything in his path.It took the efforts of multiple Spider-Men from different universes to defeat Spider-Carnage. The episode showed how intimidating the two entities are when they're bonded together.The Marvel Knights limited series Bullet Points shows a world where the Super Soldier serum is never completed and Steve Rogers never becomes Captain America. Years later, a rebellious Peter Parker travels into a secret government facility in the desert right as a gamma bomb is detonated.RELATED: Every Version Of Spider-Man Ranked From Weakest To Most PowerfulThe gamma radiation turns Peter Parker into The Hulk, while Bruce Banner's attempts to stop Peter result in him accidentally becoming Spider-Man. The comic showed that no matter who was the Hulk, they were a force to be reckoned with.Venom and Peter Parker have a long and complicated history with one another. The Symbiote has attempted to bond with Peter for years, with Peter rejecting him each time. When a Carnage-infused Norman Osborne threatens the life of Mary-Jane Watson, Venom convinces Peter that his powers alone won't be enough. The two combine, and Spider-Man's anger at Osborne causes him to fully morph into Venom.In the What If? hypothetical comic series, we see a world where Peter Parker takes the death of Uncle Ben very differently. Rather than give up the mugger to the police, he shoots him in cold blood. He takes on the mantle of the Punisher, utilizing his web slingers into chain-guns and mowing down criminals in broad daylight.While nowhere near the level of Frank Castle in terms of unhappiness, he shares the same drive to murder and punish those he views as evil people. In this case, with great power came great punishment.Marvel Comics Infinity Warps series provides a mashup of comic book characters, showing new powers, costumes and personalities for our favorite Marvel characters. One of these iterations is ArachKnight, a meld of Spider-Man and Moon Knight. In it, Peter Parker is chosen as the Avatar of the Spider-Totem, making him the defender of destiny and the great weave of date.This has split his mind into multiple personalities, similar to Moon Knights. While his powers function similarly, its fascinating to see a Peter Parker behave in the way Moon Knight does, and makes one realize how tortured Moon Knight must feel having so many personalities inside his head.In Marvel's Marvel 2 in One series, a cast of Marvel Comics characters are shown alternate realities where things took very different turns. In one of these worlds, Spider-Man was forced to kill Tony Stark and imprison Captain America due to the escalating tragedies of the Civil War storyline.RELATED: Everything We Know About Spider-Man's Role In Avengers: EndgameDoing so caused him to snap, and become a despot who rules over the wastelands. Even worse, he has taken to wearing Captain America's mask, often talking to himself as if he were Steve Rogers. When one expected to see Spider-Man as Cap, this was probably the last thing they could have thought of.During the Spider-Verse storyline, we were introduced to Spider-Man of Earth 21205. In this world, a grieving Peter Parker was unable to move on from Gwen Stacey's death. He murdered Green Goblin in cold blood and took on the Hobgoblin persona, abandoning his role as Spider-Man and turning instead to crime.Upon seeing Spider-Gwen, Spider-Goblin realizes what he has lost in the process of being the Hobgoblin. He sacrifices himself with a pumpkin bomb in order to protect Gwen from the Inheritors hot on her trail. Even as a villain, somewhere deep down Spider-Man tried to do the right thing.Is there a better combination of heroes than Deadpool and Spider-Man? Probably, but none of them are as entertaining to see. Spider-Man and Deadpool have teamed up and faced off on numerous occasions. The two smart-alecs, though different in temperament, typically end up working well together. In Deadpool Annual #2, Spider-Man is hunted by the Chameleon, who tries to drive him insane.In a stroke of genius, Deadpool and Spider-Man switch costumes. Chameleon is unable to drive Deadpool insane since he already is, and Deadpool as Spider-Man and Spider-Man as Deadpool work together to take the villain out.For all the true believers out there, this one is a great cameo. The end of the Spider-Verse storyline, Spider-Geddon has all the various Spider-Men teaming up to take down the Inheritors that have been hunting them down. In Spider-Geddon #5, we see all assembled Spider-Men for the first time. One of these is a familiar grey-haired, glasses wearing mustachioed man. Appearing in multiple panels, there is no denying that this is a Spider-Man where in his world, Stan Lee is Spider-Man.RELATED: Secret Stan Lee Cameos You Definitely Missed In Spider-Man: Into The Spider-VerseGiven that this issue came out a month after Stan Lee's death, it's clear that this was a tribute to the great comic legend. Stan Lee gave the world Spider-Man, so it's only fitting that he got to be everyone's friendly neighborhood Spider-Man at least once.NEXT: New Spider-Man: Far From Home Hasbro Toys Revealed [Exclusive]

In the not-so-distant past, TV shows depicted married couples – like Lucy and Ricky Ricardo – sleeping in separate twin beds to uphold the moral codes of the time along with censorship rules. With the sexual and social revolution of the '60s and '70s, TV started to tackle more serious social issues, such as abortion in Maude, and introduced the era of "jiggle TV" with shows like Charlie's Angels, Wonder Woman, and Three's Company.Even with these movements toward sexual liberation, American broadcast networks were and still are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), prohibiting them from airing "acts of indecency" without receiving a hefty fine (unlike movies which could easily include nudity). In 2008, the FCC proposed a $1.43 million fine against ABC TV stations for showing a partially nude woman in a 2003 episode of NYPD Blue and Janet Jackson's breast-baring wardrobe malfunction during the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show garnered CBS a proposed $550,000 fine.Free from the FCC's indecency and profanity regulations, premium cable channels in the late 90s and early 2000s started featuring programming that pushed the boundaries of what was once considered acceptable nudity on TV. In the late 90s, it wasn't uncommon to see bare breasts or butts in sex scenes. By the late 2000s, it was no longer shocking to see full frontal of a woman. And even nowadays a man's full-frontal region is no holds barred.Here's our list of the TV shows that have the most nudity, beginning in 1998.Click the button below to start this article in quick viewBased on the book of the same name by Candace Bushnell, Sex and the City follows the personal and professional lives of four 30-something plus women in New York City. SATC was one of the first shows with explicitly sexual content, featuring both explicit sex scenes and scenes of women talking explicitly about sex. It resonated with women around the world, as it examined issues women commonly experienced in their relationships, but perhaps never talked about publicly. Men have even credited the show for giving insight into the female perspective on sex and relationships.Many of the graphic sex scenes featured self-proclaimed "try-sexual" Samantha Jones. While actress Kim Cattral often exposed her breasts for the camera, nudity in some of the more explicitly sexual scenes was often hidden by undergarments and carefully-placed bedsheets. In one memorable scene, Samantha planned to greet her boyfriend with perfectly appointed sushi covering her private parts.At some point, all of the women except for Sarah Jessica Parker (whose contract stipulated no nudity), exposed their breasts for the show. There were also plenty of male bare bottoms shown throughout the series.Entourage chronicled the acting career of Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier), a young A-list movie star, and his childhood friends from Queens, New York City. According to Mark Wahlberg, the show was conceived when his assistant asked if he could film Wahlberg and his friends, as she thought they were "hilarious."In earlier seasons, women's breasts were occasionally exposed. In later seasons, particularly season seven, topless women became much more prevalent. In one episode, a brief background shot of naked men were shown on a porn set. In another episode, full-frontal female nudity was displayed in a scene of adult-film star Sasha Grey going skinny-dipping. Additionally, there were plenty of bare butts throughout the season.While the sex scenes of Entourage don't often include graphic detail, viewers witness thrusting and moaning, bare breasts of women, and both male as well as female bare bottoms.Based on the British series created by Russell T. Davies, Queer as Folk was the first hour-long drama series on American television to portray the lives of gay men and women. In order to portray gay relationships with realism, the actors had to sign a 21-page contract stipulating that they would appear nude in the show.Some critics have praised Queer as Folk for portraying the most realistic sex scenes in film and TV history - after all, it was the first show to feature a simulated sex scene between two men. While the sex was not gratuitous, and you won't see full-frontal nudity, many sex scenes looked and felt authentic.Arguably the most authentic scene of the series was when Justin Taylor (Randy Harrison) loses his virginity to Brian Kinney (Gale Harold). Not only does Brian teach Justin about the particulars of sex, but he also shows him, in graphic detail, how to perform a specific sexual act (though it is never explicitly shown).Californication follows protagonist Hank Moody (David Duchovny), an L.A.-based novelist, struggling to overcome his sex addiction, among other things like alcoholism and drug use. Ironic enough, Duchovny went to treatment for his own sex addiction during production of the show - a classic case of life imitating art imitating life.Californication featured explicit sex scenes with full female and partial male nudity. Sexual activity is realistically depicted, but explicit details are never shown onscreen. Bare breasts as well as both male and female butts are showcased throughout the series, and the show features all kinds of sexual experimentation throughout.Californication became an instant target for the religious right, who successfully lobbied advertisers in Australia and New Zealand to cease their sponsorship of the show. Nevertheless, the series remained on air for seven sex-filled seasons.Based on the blog and books by the pseudonymous "Belle de Jour," Secret Diary of a Call Girl was written by Lucy Prebble, who is also the author of The Sugar Syndrome and ENRON. The series has been compared to Sex and the City by many critics, mainly due to its humorous approach to sex.The sexual humor derives from the odd sexual requests that Hannah Baxter (Billie Piper) receives as a high-class call girl in London. For example, one client, while having sex with “Belle,” (her pseudonym) asks to refer to herself as different barnyard animals, such as a goat and pig; another client wants to wrestle sumo-style before doing the deed; and (arguably) the strangest was when a client requested bottle-feeding before sealing the deal.While there is an abundance of sex in Secret Diary, viewers are only privy to partial nudity, albeit much of it, including bare breasts and bottoms.True Blood is based on The Southern Vampire Mysteries series of novels by Charlaine Harris, detailing the co-existence of vampires and humans in Bon Temps, a fictional small town in northwestern Louisiana. Language experts have affirmed, "Bon Temps" translates as "good times," which means "Louisiana" should mean "naked" with how much nudity, sex, and overall depravity is displayed over the course of the show.Throughout the series, the audience viewed "fang-bangers," bondage, threesomes, girl-on-girl and boy-on-boy action, orgies, and more. The sex scenes throughout the show are plentiful and raunchy – "True Guilty Pleasure" at its finest.True Blood (among other shows) has been scrutinized for the amount of gratuitous female nudity it reveals while allowing for little representation of the male front. In its six seasons, there are only two instances of the full male form. For example, when the vampire goddess Lilith rises from a pool of blood and walks around fully nude for extended scenes, she and her female vampire followers are shown in full frontal. But when a male character drank Lilith’s blood and ascended from a pool of blood, the camera cuts away before it reveals what's below his waist.Spartacus is based loosely on the Thracian gladiator, who from 73 to 71 BCE led a major slave uprising against the Roman Republic departing from Capua. The series was short-lived, airing its last season in 2013. But it made its mark in TV history with an abundance of swords, savagery, and sex.Unlike many shows on premium channels, Spartacus featured full-frontal nudity from both women and men – and the number of instances was pretty equal. In fact, for some characters, including males, it was a rarity to be clothed at all. Full-frontal male nudity is the norm for this show. You won't see any complaints about sexism or the objectification of women here. In many viewers' and critics' eyes, Spartacus remains the undisputed champ of TV nudity.A list about nudity in TV shows wouldn't be complete without Game of Thrones. The amount of nudity in Spartacus often rivaled this show, but due to its popularity, Game of Thrones is more often the victor in this arena. Though plentiful, many scenes in the series leave the viewer feeling uneasy rather than titillated, unlike other HBO shows like Sex and the City or Entourage.Game of Thrones has repeatedly been scrutinized for its sexism, misogyny, gratuitous nudity, and violence against women. Like other shows discussed on this list, full-frontal nudity is common with women, which is most often depicted in the brothel scenes.While there are plenty of brazen nude scenes showcased through the series to date, last season's "walk of shame" arguably rivals them all. In the season five finale, the fallen queen, Cersie (Lena Headey with the help of a body double), is made to walk naked (full frontal and back) through the streets of King's Landing after having confessed to adultery. One of the most horrific scenes in Game of Thrones history, viewers are to surmise that even queens are subject to public humiliation.A remake of an award-winning British series, Shameless tells the story of Frank Gallagher (William H. Macy), father of six children, who spends his days drunk and high while his kids learn to take care of themselves. It's up to eldest daughter Fiona (Emmy Rossum) to provide for the family.Nude scenes are a common occurrence in Shameless, and the show is unapologetic in its depiction of teenage sexuality. The show portrays teenagers as they are – one character wants to lose her virginity and brings a "lose virginity” poster to school.Fiona is the character that can most commonly be found nude in the show. In one memorable scene, Fiona has sex in a car on top of a sandwich. She comes from a low-income family who can't afford to spend money on going out, so she has sex – a lot of it – and she likes it. Making sex look real is important to Rossum, who wasn't afraid of signing a contact stipulating nudity. Like other series on this list, such as Sex and the City or Secret Diary of a Call Girl, Shameless isn't afraid to bring humor to sexuality.Girls follows the lives of a close group of 20-somethings living in New York City. Sound familiar? Though the show has a similar overarching story-line to Sex and the City, Girls is much more sexually explicit.There are no boundaries to the amount of time the main character Hannah (Lena Dunham, who also created the show) spends naked in the show. We have seen her eating cake on a toilet nude, playing ping-pong nude, talking on the phone nude, and often just being nude for the sake of being nude.Naysayers have criticized that unlike shows such as Game of Thrones and Spartacus, the nudity in Girls is pointless, and that because her body is quote unquote "normal," Dunham plays the nudity card way too often. Dunham has stated in retaliation that the nudity actively adds authenticity as well as defies gender stereotypes - and if you don't like her body, then that's your problem.House of Lies follows a group of management consultants who stop at nothing to seal business deals and make money.The first episode opens with series protagonist Marty Kaan (Don Cheadle) waking up on his ex-wife's (Dawn Olivieri) bare butt after a night of mistake sex. Marty tries to put on Monica's tight dress on the bed, and then pulls her half naked to a chair and manages to cover her bare breasts before their child, Roscoe, enters the room. Later in that same episode, Marty visits a gentleman's club where plenty of bare breasts are exposed and two women get intimate in the bathroom.While perhaps the greatest amount of nudity is shown in the very first episode, viewers see bare breasts and sometimes bare bottoms throughout the first season. This type of nudity is displayed in subsequent seasons, though less often, and many frontal shots are often unfocused.The Girl's Guide to Depravity is a comedy/drama series based on Heather Rutman's popular book and blog of the same name. The show follows two women, Lizzie (Sally Golan) and Samantha (Rebecca Blumhagen), and the rules they use to have fun and avoid being hurt in relationships. Each episode is themed to a certain rule, such as rule #12: "The best way to get over a guy is to get underneath another guy" and rule #9: "Always be the bigger bitch."Sex is aplenty throughout the course of the show, and viewers often see exposed bare breasts and bottoms. The series has been praised for the realism it brings to sex scenes and not over-choreographing them with unnecessary and oftentimes unbelievable moaning and screaming viewers are accustomed to hearing.Masters of Sex is a period piece set in the late '50s and '60s based on the book of the same name by Thomas Maier. The show follows the story of gynecologist William Masters (Michael Sheen) who conducts research into human sexuality with assistant Virginia Johnson (Lizzy Caplan). Their research helped to launch the sexual revolution in the U.S.Masters of Sex has its fair share of nudity, but most sex scenes are shown in snippets. Furthermore, there's a lot of scientific equipment and procedures in sex scenes that don't rally very much emotion. The show doesn't have too much full-frontal nudity, but when it does the camera is typically a safe distance away from its subject – like a case study.The series focuses on the rules of sexuality more than the act - and leaves its viewers asking themselves questions like: "How have sexual mores changed?" or "Are we still reluctant to talk about sex?"Orange Is the New Black, created by Jenji Kohan, is based on Piper Kerman's memoir, Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison (2010), about her experiences at FCI Danbury.The show features its fair share of nudity - most commonly girl-on-girl encounters - since it takes place in a female prison. There are occasional instances of brief partial nudity; however, sexuality on the series is used for the purpose of exploring the relationships (both intimate and platonic) of the women locked behind bars.In the show's second season, there was a scene with full-frontal male nudity. Kohan, also the creator of Weeds on Showtime, deems that she loves graphic sex - and the more sex the better. Therefore, viewers can expect to see much more nudity in upcoming episodes.In the first season, nude scenes are so plentiful in Black Sails that it seems like just a part of everyday life for its characters. Viewers often see bare bottom and breasts, as well as full-frontal nudity. There is a brief scene in which Jon Silver is brought by his shipmates into a room to meet "Black Beard," who, as it turns out, is named after the hair that covers her private regions. The scene features brief full-frontal female nudity, as well as a few other topless women.While we see several instances of explicit female nudity, there are various instances of full-frontal male nudity in the first season as well. In one scene, a man's entire body is revealed after a woman leaves him spread eagle on a bed. Uncensored male nudity is displayed in various other scenes throughout the course of the show.While many shows discussed on this list only show the full female form,  Black Sails is an equal-opportunity nudity displayer.-Of course, with the bevy of sexually charged programming on cable networks like HBO and Showtime, it doesn't look like nudity in TV shows is declining in any way. Now, with Netflix and Amazon in on the game, there's more freedom than ever for television producers to show off their, uh, assets. Did we miss any of your favorite shows? Let us know in the comment section below!

As the Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to expand - with Phase 3 set to kick off next year and potentially more new films to be announced at Disney's D23 Expo later this week - its time to consider what new characters could be added to the already massive roster seen throughout the past twelve films (and three television series). In addition to the superheroes who have already been brought to life on the big screen and small, Marvel has a bevy of lesser-known heroes that can be brought to the world. If this year's Ant-Man proved anything, it's that Marvel has the clout to bring audiences out, even for smaller properties.Without further ado, here is Screen Rant's list of 10 underrated Marvel characters that should have their own movies.Click the button below to start this article in quick viewA character that blends together the best aspects of Spider-Man and Iron Man, Darkhawk is the alter-ego of Chris Powell, a teenager who unassumingly comes to possess a mystic alien artifact that grafts a suit of armour to his body. Incorporating abilities of flight, enhanced vision and strength, claws, glider wingers, and a force blast and shield capabilities, Darkhawk is a serious force to be reckoned with. With storylines that have seen him team up with characters both on Earth and in outer space, the possibilities are limitless for a solo outing, or an appearance in a Phase 3 film.Considered by many to be the Batman of Marvel, Moon Knight certainly offers an exotic, more supernatural story to play around with. After mercenary Marc Spector comes in contact with ancient Egyptian artifacts on a mission, he is killed by his squad, then resurrected by the moon god Khonsu. Spector decides to use his second chance at life to become a crimefighter, with his powers appearing during various points of the lunar cycle. An intriguing character who has been relegated to C-list status, Moon Knight has great potential for an origin story at the very least. The chances of him appearing in the MCU have increased recently, after S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Jasper Sitwell briefly mentions "a man in Cairo" in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Michael Morbius, a scientist who transforms into a vampiric being after a science experiment gone wrong, first appeared as a member of Spiderman's rogues gallery in 1971. Endowed with powers of flight, super strength, agile speed, and an accelerated healing factor, he is a formidable opponent who went up against the web-slinger time and time again. He doesn't have all the traits of a traditional vampire, though his condition does require feasting on human blood for sustenance and aversion to sunlight. Over time, Morbius was slowly rewritten from antagonist to hero, eventually getting his own series and a renewed sense of fan interest. There are numerous options for portrayal should a Morbius film ever be made, but the character would surely make for a fine gothic addition to the MCU.First debuting in 1939, Namor the Sub-Mariner is often equated with DC Comics' Aquaman, namely that of various aquatic abilities and super strength. The major point of divergence comes from Namor's sense of hostility towards land-based beings, and as such he has been regarded as a definitive anti-hero.  The rights to Namor were purchased by Universal Studios several years ago during the initial Marvel craze kicked off by X-Men, though no film ever materialized. Kevin Feige has recently confirmed that Marvel Studios does have the rights back now, though a number of contracts and agreements still need to be resolved before any chance of a green light could happen.As Marvel has begun to move into the cosmic realm - with Thor, Guardians of the Galaxy and next fall's Doctor Strange - it would make sense to give the titular Nova of the Nova Corps his own film. The moniker has been adorned by two notable figures, originally Richard Rider, and more recently the teenager Sam Alexander in the Marvel Now! relaunch of the series. Both characters have similar origins - through alien contact that granted each a super suit with the powers of flight, super strength, and invulnerability. Director James Gunn has already stated that Richard Rider will not appear in his upcoming sequel Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but that doesn't count out a solo film for either Nova. If Marvel wanted to use Sam Alexander instead, it would be the perfect way to craft a more family-friendly entry to the MCU.A reformed criminal with a vast array of gadgetry, the Prowler is the embodiment of many comic fans desires to become a hero in their own right, without the aid of superhuman abilities. The original Prowler, Hobie Brown, was inspired to create his own secret identity after witnessing Spider-Man battle Stilt-Man, though initially he decided to use it for personal gain over helping others. After foregoing a life of crime, Prowler would team up with Spider-Man on various occasions, and even team up with other reformed villains to form a group known as The Outlaws. The inspiration for the Prowler came from a teenage John Romita Jr., who years later became a famous illustrator and co-created Kick-Ass with Mark Millar, a story with many thematic similarities.A hero who has been reinvented and existed as the alter-ego for several beings, Quasar derives his power from a set of 'quantum bands', which he uses to fight the evils of intergalactic tyranny. Another potential figure that could lend themselves to a cosmic outing, Quasar mainly deals with supremely powerful beings with god-like attributes. While he is more obscure than Doctor Strange or Star-Lord, the character demonstrates a sense of decency and ethics to his actions, all in the aim of peace. Such purely good-willed characters are not that common in the MCU so far, which could make for an interesting confrontation with any pre-established super-powered team or being further down the line.Jennifer Walters, a lawyer known for representing superheroes, becomes She-Hulk after receiving a blood transfusion from her cousin, Dr. Bruce Banner. Shortly thereafter, she begins to exhibit the same shade of green skin and abilities of incredible strength and rage, albeit with more control of her intelligence and personality. Having been a member of various organizations within Marvel lore, such as The Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D. The Defenders, and the Fantastic Four, there's no telling to the possibilities the character has in terms of on-screen representation. On top of that, Walters is a progressive female character who could serve as a positive role model for many young girls, should she be considered for inclusion.One of the most famous Marvel characters that lacks any powers whatsoever, Silver Sable has appeared frequently over the last 30 years as both an opponent and ally to Marvel characters. Displaying sublime athleticism and detailed knowledge of various martial arts, she is the closest thing to a female version of The Punisher, though her primary goals revolve around bringing justice to war criminals and those who commit acts of terrorism. A film based entirely around this character could certainly play up the real-world aspect of the MCU, foregoing the more fantastic elements more commonly seen, grounded in real world circumstances.Doreen Green, otherwise known as Squirrel Girl, might be one of the oddest superheroes in Marvel's roster, but a potential film could certainly result in a comedic outing on-par with this summer's Ant-Man. Squirrel Girl possesses super-strength, sharp claws and a rapacious bushy tail. She can leap to great heights and - most importantly of all - communicate with squirrels. The character has gone through an increase in popularity recently with the launch of her own series, The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, last fall. Besides that, she's one of the most powerful beings in the entire Marvel universe, having defeated the likes of Doctor Doom, Galactus, and even Thanos at various points in her existence. Whether or not she displays this level of fortitude on-screen, if Marvel is serious about adding more strong female characters to the MCU, Squirrel Girl would be an inspired choice.–Which of these characters would you most like to see get their own film? Who else do you think needs to be recognized in the MCU? Sound off in the comments below!

There is a specious superstition that - according to some (mis-)reading of the Mayan calendar - the world is supposed to end on Friday, December 21, 2012.With that in mind, we at Screen Rant came up with a list of 10 ways to actually save the world, using lessons we've learned from movies. In each of these movies, the world - or life as we know it - was close to destruction, but people (or circumstances) found ways to prevent it.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE MOVIES IN OUR LIST!!!Subscribe for the hottest movie, TV, and gaming news!*I agree to let Screen Rant send me emails.
Having made Dr. No and From Russia With Love, Terence Young solidified himself as the granddaddy director of the Connery era films with the fourth film of the franchise. Thunderball is a cracking good flick, replete with jetpacks, oceanic fights and blackjack gaming between Bond and the villain, Largo, in a veritable tropical paradise.H20is the running theme in this fourth Bond film, and it manages to permeate Q’s world of gadgets in a ludicrous way. In what was perhaps an early design model for the Super Soaker, Bond’s Aston-Martin uses tailpipe water cannons to ward off a group of guards. While these bad boys might have been all the rage in 1965, the producers over at Eon Productions have learned one thing in the fifty years since Thunderball: leave the industrial water hoses to the fire brigade.Subscribe for the hottest movie, TV, and gaming news!*I agree to let Screen Rant send me emails.
Zombies get a bad rap. Sure, they’re ugly, they drool everywhere, they eat brains and destroy civilizations, but it’s not like they’re doing it on purpose. Sometimes, all a zombie needs is a little guidance. This is not the conclusion one would draw from The Walking Dead, in which zombies are, without exception, pretty awful. Will this change in the upcoming spin-off, Fear the Walking Dead? Who knows?Since George A. Romero invented the modern zombie genre with 1968's Night of the Living Dead, zombies have been portrayed as mindless creatures, unable to think, acting on pure, brain-eating instinct (OK the brain-eating specifics only came in 1985’s The Return of the Living Dead). But over the course of nearly five decades, a few films and television shows have dared to show us the nicer, kinder side of zombies.Here is our list of 10 zombies with GREAT personalities!Click the button below to start this article in quick viewIn the third film of his loosely connected Dead series, George A. Romero decided to go beyond the conceit of the previous two films - that people are coming back from the dead and attacking the living - in order to ponder what it actually means to be a zombie. With Bub (Howard Sherman), Romero asks if its possible for zombies to think, or to have emotions, and it turns out that they can. Though kept in captivity, Bub shows the ability to solve simple problems, to follow routines, and to remember things. He even listens to music. In other words, he’s a good dude. Who wouldn’t want a grab a few brews with a Bub like this!The joke at the heart of Shaun of the Dead - which is so embedded in the narrative of the film that it almost stops being a joke at all - is that the majority of humans are basically zombies to begin with. This is especially true of Ed (Nick Frost), the eating, farting, video game-playing best friend and roommate of the titular Shaun (Simon Pegg). After getting bitten by a zombie later in the film, Ed retains many of the same characteristics that as he did while he was human, including his role as Shaun’s best friend. In fact, Shaun keeps Ed chained in the garage to play video games with, under the rules that he can’t get too close with his big ol’ slobbery zombie mouth.Most people hear the name “Fido” and assume that it refer to a cute, fluffy dog. Maybe a Border Collie, or a Russell Terrier. But in this low-budget Canadian comedy, Fido is the name of a rather adorable zombie servant (Billy Connolly). Fido takes place in an alternate universe wherein zombies have been quelled and forced into servitude by collars produced by “Zomcon,” a vaguely evil-sounding corporation. Nevertheless, the captive Fido develops an unorthodox friendship with Timmy (K’Sun Ray), the son of the family that owns him. As a long-time portrayer of lovable, eccentric Scots, Connolly does an excellent job at making us empathize with this loveable, eccentric zombie. Fido is truly the Lassie of brain-eating undead.For the fourth entry in George A. Romero’s Dead series, the godfather of zombies expands his exploration of sentient zombies even further. With Bub in Day of the Dead, Romero explored a zombie with emotions and memory. With Big Daddy (Eugene Clark), Romero explores the possibility that zombies might begin to redevelop their lost intelligence after spending enough time infected. Daddy, a former gas station attendant still wearing his coveralls, learns how to use an assault rifle, making him a dangerous leader of the undead. Big Daddy’s character gains resonance as a metaphor for disadvantaged people who are locked out of centers of power and wealth. If he seems angry and vindictive as he leads a mass of zombie buds up to the gates of Fiddler’s Green - a fortified and protected city of the living - it’s understandable; Big Daddy hasn’t eaten in weeks and he is very peckish.With their faces constantly in danger of falling off, it’s kind of hard to read a zombie’s facial expression, let alone figure out what they’re feeling on the inside. Given that they can’t talk, you can’t really be sure of how much of your conversations they understand, either. This is R's (Nicholas Hoult) predicament in Warm Bodies. R is a zombie with a heart of gold and at least some smarts (as it turns out, zombies strategize among themselves while hunting for flesh). While out on a hunt with some of his zombie buds, R decides to save the pretty Julie (Teresa Palmer) from the others... because he has a crush. As with Bub in Day of the Dead, R is a zombie slowly developing his humanity back. Warm Bodies questions the finality of zombie-ism, and whether or not it’s truly an incurable ill. If R is any indication, then there can still be some sweetness underneath the rotting flesh of a zombie.Liv (Rose McIver) is a zombie, but she’s pretty good at hiding it. She eats brains, but only from people who are already dead. She sometimes has violent urges, but can generally keep them in check. She’s very pale, but she throws on some lipstick every once in a while. For whatever reason, Liv survived the transition into zombie-dom with most of her critical faculties in check. She’s a lot more dour now, but no more than you would expect from someone who works at a morgue (where she takes care of her dietary needs by collecting brain from the cadavers). As it turns out, she also gets visions of the lives of dead people she comes into contact with, which makes her pretty good at solving crimes and a valuable contact for Detective Clive Babineaux (Malcolm Goodwin). iZombie was developed by Rob Thomas and Diane Ruggiero-Wright, who previously worked on the cult favorite Veronica Mars, and this show contains much of the same charm. And part of that charm comes from Rose McIver as Liv, the dead, cold, but very endearing heart of the show.OK, OK, Frankenstein’s monster isn’t technically a zombie. Both Mary Shelley’s novel and James Whale’s classic 1931 adaptation pre-date the creation of the modern zombie in 1968’s Night of the Living Dead, and they weren’t related to the 1930s Voodoo zombies of White Zombie either. Yet, the monster shares an awful lot of characteristics with his zombie brethren. He’s dead, he’s brought back to life, he consists of dead body parts, and he has no way of communicating with the humans that want to kill him. As Boris Karloff’s performance makes clear, Frankenstein’s monster doesn’t particularly want to be the terrifying creature that he is, and he fails to understand the fear that his presence creates in other people or the damage that he can cause. When the local townspeople burn down a mill that contains the monster, we can’t help but wonder how things might have been different if they truly understood how he felt.Like Frankenstein’s monster, Kyle (Evan Peters) isn’t technically a zombie, but like Frankenstein’s monster, he’s pretty darn close. Cut together from the best parts of various dead frat boys, Kyle is a sweet, sensitive, undead boy with some serious emotional issues. If you’re unfamiliar with Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk’s American Horror Story series, you should know that this creative duo has never encountered a plot twist that they thought was too shocking or extreme. Even before he learns how to talk, Kyle is thrust into a polyamorous relationship with two witches (Taissa Farmiga and Emma Roberts), one of whom can’t have sex without killing her partner (which is why it’s handy that Kyle is already dead). After a while, Kyle learns to control his body, his emotions, and his tongue, but he never loses his innocence.ParaNorman, or Norman for short (or maybe Norm if you want to go really short), is a small-town boy who runs into problems because he sometimes unwittingly speaks to the dead. After a few cute, shambling zombies pop out of their graves, however, Norm (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) learns to use his powers to reign them in. As it turns out, these zombies aren’t so bad. a few hundred years ago they were town councilors, who sentenced a woman to death for witchcraft and were cursed by her as she burned on the stake. BUT: they know they were wrong! And the whole “coming back as zombies” thing is a pretty fair punishment. Anyway, they’ve learned their lesson, and they encourage Norm to get in touch with the spirit of the dead witch, who was really a medium like Norm.You know Bill Murray! He’s the scene-stealing star of Caddyshack, the beloved scientist Steve Zissou, the funny guy from Stripes, Meatballs, and Ghostbusters. He’s also the charming fellow who might give a groom some advice on wedding night, join some strangers for karaoke or kickball, or spend the night bartending at a music festival. He’s a great guy! And he’s that same great guy in Zombieland, in which he plays himself. He invites the gang into his giant Hollywood mansion, plays games with them, gives them liquor and shows them a good time. He also, sadly, puts on some zombie make-up and gets himself shot by a jumpy teenager who goes by the name “Columbus” (played by human ball of nerves Jesse Eisenberg). Granted, he may not be a real zombie, but what’s a real zombie anyway? Besides, the pickings for this list are getting a little thin. Cut us some slack.-As we mentioned, there aren’t too many zombies with good personalities out there. Most of them are real moody and don’t have much time for conversation. Did we miss any genial walkers? Can you point us toward any zombie gems that we can take out for dinner and maybe buy a drink? Let us know in the comments below!

The 100 has captivated young fans with its high drama, action, and sci-fi intrigue. Between all the different factions and events, the main characters have to endure a lot of threats and danger. To think in season one, falling from space would become the least of Clarke's problems. Clarke has gone from a heartbroken, brilliant teen to the young, fierce mother of the Grounders' leader. It's quite the evolution.RELATED: 15 Secrets Behind The 100 You Had No Idea AboutWith only eight confirmed alive, The 100 have come a long way. They've dealt with dangerous factions and the strongest, or the luckiest, have survived. While fans wait in the coming months for season 6, it's a good time to look back at the factions that plagued the lives of The 100. Here are the deadliest nations/groups, ranked.Click the button below to start this article in quick viewIn The 100, the Grounders consist of 13 clans. However, some of them are too unknown to give a fair assessment. This includes people Rock Line, Lake People, Delphi, and more.While fans get to see glimmers of them during the Grounders Coalition, they don't have many, if any, named characters and are simply ideas more than they are a culture. No one knows if they'll be explored more in future seasons, but for now, they get put at the bottom of the ranking. If they haven't posed a threat thus far, they don't pose enough threat to be mentioned much.The Mountain Men were introduced in the second season. More '"civilized" like the Sky People, the community under Mount Weather seemed like a group of people trying to survive. However, they eventually started using the 48 Delinquents they housed to protect them from the radiation.With armaments, dangerous medical procedures, and modern technology, the Mountain Men seem to pose a serious threat. On the other hand, though, considering a bit of fresh air causes them to break out in hives and can kill them, they aren't very threatening at all. As of the current season on The 100, all of the known Mountain Men aren't alive anymore.Though fans don't know much about Trishanakru, the people of the Glowing Forest, they do know one very important member of the clan: Ilian. The Trishanakru people are sentimental, spiritual, and simple. They believe in specific burial rituals and tending to their families. However, that devotion can lead to a lot of danger.RELATED: Twilight: 19 Things Wrong With Edward Cullen We All Choose To IgnoreUnder control of A.L.I.E., Ilian decimated his own family while trying to infect them. When she was turned off, he tried to save his mother, but she passed away from his own torture methods. She did ask him to avenge her, though. Ilian took this prompt to attack the Sky People, trying to burn down some of their base.Eventually, he becomes entangled with Octavia and forges his own path, but love and faith can make people do very dangerous things.Floukru is objectively the most peaceful clan that fans meet in The 100, choosing to live on a barge to avoid any and all conflict. When Lincoln wants to escape the Trikru/Delinquents conflict, this is where he planned to take Octavia.With their decision to stay, the show didn't introduce Floukru until they were looking for a Nightblood to replace Lexa as Commander. After all, the Floukru leader, Luna, is the only known Nightblood alive other than Ontari. Though the clan is weak when it comes to weapons or defenses, having a Nightblood lead them is powerful. If Luna ever wanted to claim her birthright, they could come into a lot of power.However, with the plague wiping everyone out except Luna, Floukru meets an untimely fate.Though Sangedakru is a fairly big mystery, two of its members have shone a light on the kind of people the Desert Clan raises. Between Brell and Caris, the people of the desert are fearless leaders that won't stand down and will try to do what's right for the whole. Brell dared argue against the Blood Queen, and Caris put her life in danger and left Octavia behind. The group would not be endangered for one person's decisions.If the rest of the clan is just as fierce as Caris and Brell, of course, they'd be a dangerous group to go up against.As if the clans of The 100 didn't have enough to deal with, after Praimfaya the once slumbering Eligius Prisoners land down and run into Clarke and Madi. Mutinizing, Charmaine Diyoza and her band of criminals have taken over the Eligius Corp. ship and are setting out to explore their new world and survive. When they find desolation, though, things start to get dangerous.RELATED: Damon Wayans Producing CW Series With First Gender Non-Conforming LeadWilling to do anything to ensure their own goals met, the prisoners lie, torture, take hostages, and end lives. Though they aren't a large group, their munitions and ruthlessness alone make them a serious threat to all other groups on Earth.While Louwoda Kliron may not be very powerful as a clan, they have one impressive card up their sleeve: Madi Griffon. Meant to fall to Praimfaya like the rest of her people, Madi survived because of her Nightblood and survived by running into Clarke Griffon. Other than the clan members in the bunker, Madi became the only Shadow Valley Grounder left.RELATED: The 100 Season 5 ReviewCreating a mother-daughter bond, Clarke and Madi became the only Nightbloods left in the world. When Wonkru emerged from underground, Madi took over her right as Commander. As the leader of all Grounders left on the world, even one Louwoda Kliron became a dangerous figure.The space station had questionable protocol before it fell, to say the least. They used the 100 delinquents as guinea pigs to see if they could survive on the surface. Fortunately for them, they could. Unfortunately, they sent the teens down there woefully unprepared.No one expected the Grounders or the battles the Delinquents would have to fight. Though they lost many, the group proved strong and found a place for themselves on Earth. Full of ingenuity, resourcefulness, and a will to live, the Delinquents weren't a group to be trifled with.Though the Delinquents repelled Trikru's assaults, ultimately Trikru is much stronger. They are a defensive and determined people, and given enough time, would have overtaken the Delinquents. After all, they did decimate about half of the group while only taking some casualties on their part. They still had ample warriors, they were just being pragmatic.Furthermore, the Woods Clan is fairly diplomatic. They're intelligent about their decisions, but also willing to make a deal when it makes sense. Consisting of impressive characters like Indra and Lincoln, the Woods Clan is a strong group of people. In a larger conflict, they're a very dangerous group to go up against. Especially now that they count Octavia, the Blood Queen, among their ranks.Of all the specific Grounders clans, the Ice Nation of Azgeda is likely the most intimidating. They're a people that constantly live in harsh winters, they aren't above treachery, and they are fierce combatants. While Roan has proved a useful ally, his mother can be a manipulative queen.RELATED: The CW Discussing Gossip Girl RebootConsidering all the work the clan did to try to upheave Lexa and the bid for next Commander, they are a constant threat. Sure, they may be in accordance with Wonkru right now. However, they always have their own agendas first.However, with Nia and Roan gone, the power-hungry nation is crippled if they ever separate from Wonkru.Survival-minded humans with advanced technology are always dangerous, and the Sky People are no different. Skaikru is just as likely as other clans to do things in their own selfish interest instead of what's best for everyone.The Delinquents were a big enough threat to cause trouble, but all of their space-faring community joining them makes them very dangerous. When they take diplomatic approaches, they can bring a lot of people together. However, when things get tyrannical or violent, they take a huge, bloody bite out of other groups.Skaikru is an understandable, uncomfortable threat that the Grounders had every right to be wary of.One of the most dangerous threats to come to The 100 was A.L.I.E. An AI gone warped, A.L.I.E. was a program meant to save humanity. However, she took that to mean saving them in a database instead of saving the world. With all the danger in the world, it was an easy solution.An added bonus was that A.L.I.E. took to using happiness as a drug and the bodies of her followers to do her bidding. After all, it's easy to eliminate threats when you have sleep agents and hostage family members. A.L.I.E. almost spread throughout the world before The 100 cast figured out how to disable her.If they hadn't, she would have taken over everyone without much resistance. That's one impressive, insidious threat.When Clarke and crew discovered the world was going to be facing Praimfaya, a relentless plague, the Grounders had a conclave to chose an immediate Commander based on combat skill alone, not Nightblood.

If the Coalition didn't fall to A.L.I.E.'s cult or Praimfaya, it would have remained the most dangerous, intimidating force on the planet. Unfortunately, the planet had different plans.NEXT: What To Expect From The 100 Season 6

The end of The 100 season 4 promised big changes on the horizon. After all, when you turn the setting of your series into a barren, radioactive wasteland, you’re going to have to shuffle things around a bit. And the start of the new season is a little like the show has hit the reset button, as characters who may have grown comfortable in their roles and within the dynamics of several larger groups have all been forced to reconfigure in order to survive. Some, like Bellamy (Bob Morley) and his crew have returned to space, while most of the others have moved underground. Meanwhile, Clarke (Eliza Taylor) has not only managed to survive the nuclear fallout, she’s discovered her own Eden and made a new, potentially more fulfilling life for herself by becoming a surrogate mother to a young girl named Madi (Lola Flanery). That’s a pretty big shift in the series’ status quo, as the time jump sends everyone forward six years in time, so as to not have to deal with all that pesky radiation and whatnot. But the season premiere doesn’t jump forward right off the bat. Instead, it holds off on seeing what the future brings to better focus on Clarke’s journey after making the ultimate sacrifice at the end of season 4. What should have otherwise been a death sentence for the character turns into an entirely new lease on life, one that only begins after she’s spent some time going through her own personal Mad Max-like scenario. For the hour to focus almost entirely on Clarke is a smart decision, as the character’s newfound circumstances deliver the most emotional bang for the viewers’ proverbial buck. In the wake of the devastation that’s obliterated almost all life on the planet, Clarke’s journey has the kind of emotional gravity the series needs in order to have the greatest impact while revealing the state of the show’s unique world. In short, it’s not good. Clarke wanders through the wreckage of the Earth for months before discovering an untouched valley, while essentially knocking on death’s door. It’s basically the valley from Z For Zachariah, complete with its own lone survivor. This time, however, its a half-feral girl named Madi. Madi and Clarke’s introduction goes about as well as any first-time introduction does on The 100, with Clarke falling into a bear trap and Madi attempting to stab her. Not one to let a bad first impression ruin a friendship between who might be the only two living humans on the planet, Clarke tries again, and eventually wins the child over with her artistic skills. From there, the series jumps forward six years. You know this because Clarke has a new haircut and she can spear a fish in a lake while still standing on the shore. The transition is almost exactly the one Robert Zemeckis used to jump five years ahead in Cast Away. This time, though, it’s debatable whether or not Clarke and Madi want to be found. With a title like ‘Eden,’ it’s pretty clear where the show figures Clarke stands on the matter, and as is usual, The 100 isn’t interested in watching as one of its characters finds peace and happiness. But the season premiere does spend more time than is expected with Clarke in her new role as mother and in the tiny bit of paradise she’s carved out with Madi. All of that builds up to an acute sense of loss when a group aboard a prisoner transport ship shows up out of nowhere, ready to claim Clarke’s Eden for their very own. The arrival of the transport ship is tantamount to an invasion, and The 100 is keen to treat it as such. Despite the heavy emphasis on Clarke throughout much of the episode, the premiere really is about redefining the status quo. But the relatively small amount of time actually dedicated to the other groups winds up being one of the premiere’s best moves. Up in space, Bellamy has assumed a leadership role with the small group who managed to escape, and though they’ve been working to find a way back down to the planet, it’s really the arrival of the prison ship that becomes their saving grace. It looks very different from the ground, however, as the group, led by Ivana Mlilicevic’s Charmaine Diyoza, has zero qualms with announcing their arrival with a military-style show of force, even if it’s Clarke who draws first blood. But that’s just The 100 keeping it 100 (sorry). The show excels at being a conflict engine, and although the season 5 premiere may have taken a slight detour and given Clarke a six-year break from familiar external threats, it’s clear how easily the writers’ room slips the characters back into a comfortable rhythm. That rhythm is, of course, all about making things as difficult as possible for the core cast of characters. Keeping them apart for the hour is a smart move, as it seems like it may take at least another episode before Bellamy, Murphy, and the others are back on the planet. That leaves plenty of room for the series to delve into what’s going on in the bunker, as the brief glimpse into that dark and brutal world proved to be a strong tease that was worth the wait. If anything, the season 5 premiere proved that time jumps can offer more than just intrigue as to what transpired since the characters were last seen. Here is brings the characters into maturity and points them in a new direction, one that’s as uncertain as ever thanks to a massive shakeup in the status quo. Next: Westworld Season 2 Review: More Self-Aware & Increasingly Over-EngineeredThe 100 continues next Tuesday with ‘Red Queen’ @9pm on The CW.

Season 5 of The 100 is going all in on its time jump by putting characters together in order to explore new group dynamics, like Bellamy (Bob Morley) and Murphy (Richard Harmon) being aboard the space station, as part of a small cluster of survivors. That new dynamic will alter how certain characters interact, but it will also open the door for many of them to demonstrate the degree to which they’ve matured and changed, at least that’s what one actor says. The CW’s post-apocalyptic series has always enjoyed playing around with the idea of conflict within groups both large and small, and even though the series’ fifth season is something of a reset, old habits die hard. And as season 5 explores in its premiere, even groups who’ve been locked up in space for 6 years will have grown into a family that still has plenty of issues. Harmon made the comments during a recent visit to the set of The 100, attended by Screen Rant. The actor had to dance around spoilers, but managed to offer up an intriguing tease without ruining things for the audience. He says that being in close proximity for so long has changed the survivors, but their new bond won’t change The 100’s tried-and-true formula. Harmon said:“Without giving away too much about the relationship we have up in space, after six years with just that same group of six or seven people, you kind of become a family after that amount of time. But families aren't perfect, you have issues with each other. But we're all obviously a lot closer. A lot of the issues that we've had probably are in the past after six years. I've said this before: a lot of therapy can happen in six years. But that doesn't mean new qualms with each other won't arise. It's The 100; we're gonna have issues.”The survivors in space have all assembled around Bellamy. Harmon thinks that leadership position suits the Bob Morley's character just fine, and that it’s a role he’s more than earned. And in season 5, viewers will be seeing a new, more balanced Bellamy leading his group. “I think Bellamy is so well-suited for that kind of position. He's proved it time and time again. Obviously not so well in the beginning. He was well-intentioned, but kind of did things in an improper way, and I might have also had something to do with that... But I think, it's like Clarke said at the end of last year, he's got to learn to focus his mind and his heart. I think he has become -- at the beginning of the season you see that he's assumed the leadership role and... you're going to see that he has heeded that advice and now implements that sort of system of the mind and the heart.”Next: Westworld Season 2 Review: More Self-Aware & Increasingly Over-EngineeredThe 100 season 5 premieres tonight with ‘Eden’ @9pm on The CW.

The 100 season 6 is on the way, but what can audiences expect from the upcoming batch of new episodes? The 100 is one of The CW's only non-comic book shows, and it's remained one of their best programs ever since it premiered in spring 2014. Based primarily on the first installment of the four-part novel series of the same name by Kass Morgan, The 100 was developed for television by Jason Rothenberg, who has acted as showrunner ever since, thus leading to a cohesive experience for fans.Last season of The 100 was an interesting one, since it came after a six-year time jump, and it introduced a brand-new enemy faction into the equation. Furthermore, the fact that everyone was fighting over the last survivable piece of land on the planet meant things really were worse than they had ever been - and it even worsened as the season went on. Now, Earth can no longer be lived on... thanks to multiple nuclear apocalypses. But that twist makes for an even better story arc in The 100 season 6.Related: Secrets Behind The 100 You Had No Idea AboutThe 100 season 6 is fast approaching, which now takes the story beyond Earth. Since there aren't too many characters still alive from the first 100 people that were sent down to Earth, The 100 season 6 could theoretically create a new 100 for the planet the came across in The 100 season 5 finale. It'll certainly be exciting for fans of the franchise to get something knew after five years on the air, but when does season 6 premiere and what can audiences expect from the new storyline?The 100 season 6 premieres on April 30, 2019. It comes approximately one year after The 100 season 5 premiered in mid-April 2018, which falls in line with the series premiering in the middle of spring every year. This time, The 100 season 6 will be replacing Roswell, New Mexico in its 9 pm timeslot, after the reboot series wraps up its first season the week prior. So, for at least a few weeks, The 100 season 6 will follow The Flash season 5.The 100 season 6 takes the story in a brand new direction, one that not only takes place 125 years further into the future but is also set on a new world. In The 100 season 5 finale, everyone abandoned Earth for the last time and embarked on a new journey to find another Goldilocks planet for them to survive on. But they surprisingly lost two of their main characters in the process, as they spent that century searching for the new planet while the rest of the people slept in hibernation.What's interesting about this new storyline is that it's a chance to begin anew, with a new cast as well. Since The 100 season 5 finale was envisioned as a series finale, The 100 season 6 is taking the series beyond the books and into its own tale.As previously mentioned, The 100 season 5 was originally conceived as the series finale since the show's producers didn't know if The CW would order another batch of episodes. But they did, and so The 100 season 6 is happening. However, now that The 100 TV show has mostly broken off from the books, that means there's potential for it to continue for years to come, or for it to end once and for all. There's no word on if The 100 season 7 will happen, but if a renewal order doesn't happen sometime in May, then it'll certainly look like as if The 100 season 6 is the final season.More: Every TV Show Ending In 2019

“Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results”. – Albert EinsteinMr. Einstein could have very well been talking about Hollywood and all of the video game movies turds it has squeezed out in the past 27 years. Some people incorrectly think the wretched Super Mario Brothers kicked off the video game movie trend in 1993 but actually it started way back in 1984 with the thriller Cloak & Dagger, based off the Atari game, starring a young Henry Thomas (E.T.) and Dabney Coleman.Regardless of which year we start from, there have been dozens of movies made from video games and, although some have come close (Mortal Kombat, Tomb Raider), NONE have actually been good. There have been some financially successful video game films but a large box office draw doesn’t always equal a “good film” (ehem Transformers 2).Need proof that all video game films to date have been utter rubbish? Take a look at what is in the garbage pile:Cloak & Dagger, Super Mario Brothers, Double Dragon, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Wing Commander, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, Resident Evil, House of the Dead, Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Alone in the Dark, House of the Dead II, Doom, BloodRayne, Silent Hill, Dead or Alive, Postal, BloodRayne II: Deliverance, Hitman, In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale, Far Cry, Max Payne, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, Alone in the Dark IIAnd those are just the films that been released so far. The list of upcoming films based on video games doesn’t do anything to increase my faith that Hollywood can make a good adaptation:Silent Hill 2, Kane & Lynch, Mass Effect, World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, BioShock, Castlevania, , Gears of War, Halo, Metal Gear Solid, Dead Space, Hitman 2, Dante’s Inferno, Spy Hunter, Asteroids, The Sims, Rollercoaster Tycoon, SporeThere are probably a lot more upcoming video game adaptations that I can’t think of right now, but those are just off the top of  Google my head. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time released last week to mixed reviews and later this year our eyeballs will be pummeled by Tekken, King of Fighters, and Resident Evil: Afterlife.It’s not fair to talk bad about films that haven’t been released yet but judging from their trailers, Tekken and King of Fighters have secured their spot in the garbage pile, while Resident Evil looks like it could actually be fun. Only time will tell if any of these future releases will manage to redeem the video game movie genre. At the time of this writing, Prince of Persia was sitting at a 48% Rotten Tomato score and, even though I consider Prince of Persia to be the best video game movie adaptation to date, that's pretty much like saying this pile of garbage doesn't stink as bad as that pile of garbage.I think I see the why most, if not all, of these films will ultimately fail – because Hollywood is picking the wrong games. Asteroids, Spore, Rollercoaster Tycoon, and The Sims as feature length films – seriously!?! These games have no back story or character development to pull from and were never meant to be made into a 90 minute feature length film. The writers for these films have no choice but to make something dumb up for a plot.Well if they can do it then so can I! I have compiled a list of 1001 (that’s 9 in binary for our less geeky readers) video games that I think are so ridiculous that Hollywood just has to make them into films.Ready? Let's start with a time traveling space opera comedy...

[This is a review of the 11.22.63 miniseries premiere. There will be SPOILERS.]-Not that adaptations of Stephen King's novels have ever been in short supply, but after the debacle that was CBS' poorly conceived and even more poorly executed series based on Under the Dome, it is safe to say the author was deserving of a more proficient and presentable television adaptation of his work. And, as a glossy miniseries debuting on TV-friendly streaming service Hulu, starring the likes of James Franco, Chris Cooper, and up-and-comer Sarah Gadon – not to mention hailing from producer J.J. Abrams – proficient and presentable is precisely what 11.22.63 aims to be. But first and foremost, the 90-minute premiere – directed by Last King of Scotland director Kevin Macdonald – aims to be an entertaining romp through time, as Franco's goateed, recently divorced high school English teacher Jake Epping steps into the past to take on another man's mission in an effort to prevent the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.There is something telling about the 90-minute premiere that doesn't have much to do with offering the audience a more substantial runtime as a way of legitimizing 11.22.63 as a serious kind of adaptation. Rather the 90-minute runtime has more to do with getting the necessary exposition out of the way, so that the remainder of the premiere, 'Down the Rabbit Hole,' can also offer the audience a glimpse of what's to come – which is, of course, a fun journey with potentially high stakes that, despite a few questionable early detours, makes the most out of its science fiction-meets-historical fiction premise of a man out of time saving the president.The first 30 minutes of 'Down the Rabbit Hole' are devoted to setting up the premise of the series, and it is clearly a daunting task the premiere is amazingly well suited for. While waiting for Jake, his faithful customer and lover of hamburgers unknowingly imported from 1960, to finalize his divorce, Chris Cooper's Al Templeton, the proprietor of a local greasy spoon that itself looks like a relic of a bygone era, steps into a closet in the diner's backroom and spends the next few years attempting to prevent Kennedy's assassination. Templeton emerges two minutes later, having aged considerably and diagnosed with terminal cancer.Naturally, asking anyone to explain the particulars of what has happened and what needs to happen via anything sounding remotely like actual conversational dialogue is something of a tough sell, especially when it also requires Franco to adorn an agog facial expression and tell Al how suddenly old and weary he looks. To its credit, though, 11.22.63 knows the difference between having a good premise and having to explain that premise as a means of putting the plot in motion. So, rather than dwell on the particulars or try to make something viable out of some very silly sounding claptrap, the premiere opts to treat it like an unpleasant but necessary procedure. The series' opening is upfront and almost apologetic about the exposition, but it agrees to barrel through it and, like a parent with a child on the receiving end of a doctor's needle, promises the audience a treat for being so brave and soldiering on.That treat, then, comes in the form of a committed performance from Franco and a commitment on behalf of the miniseries itself to take the narrative seriously, while still having fun with the basic premise and potential logical paradoxes of time travel. For a series like this to work, it can either wink at the camera and offer up a sense that the performers are aware of their being smarter than the material, or it can go in whole hog. 11.22.63 chooses the latter. One of the ways the series accomplishes this is in the way it sells the potential ramifications of altering the past, but also in the story's unwavering devotion to the idea of humanity at the center of its premise.As much as the story is about a man stepping through a time portal in a diner's closet to prevent the president's assassination, and as much as it revels in exploring the Oliver Stone-level conspiratorial fringe of Kennedy's death, 11.22.63 has a deeply moral center driving the narrative. It is, at heart, an anti-war story that wrestles (in a sometimes simplistic manner) with the ethics of taking a life to save a life or, in the case of Jake's primary objective and, certainly, his secondary one involving the murdered Dunning clan in Kentucky, potentially taking a life to save and improve the lives of many. There is a great deal of certainty placed in Al's theories that if Kennedy was to be saved the escalation of the Vietnam War – and Al's participation in it – would never have happened. That certainty, then, bleeds into Jakes decision to right the wrong of what happened to Harry Dunning (Leon Rippy), which works to underline the series' exploration of morality and choice, but also strangely destabilizes the narrative's propulsion at an early point in the series.Pulling the brake to explore a tangent that underlines one of the major themes and ideas of the story is admittedly a risky thing to do so early in the miniseries. Although the reasons behind it are basically sound – put Jake in a moral quandary wherein he can potentially effect positive change for someone he cares about and ostensibly demonstrates his ability to carry out his primary objective – the implementation and timing of the digression effectively grinds the A-plot to a halt.Although the premiere and the miniseries as a whole are an entertaining, worthwhile endeavor for King fans and non-fans alike, the inconsistency or lopsidedness of the first episode (and some of the later ones) in terms of focus, keeps the story from being as propulsive and enticing as it otherwise could be. What's frustrating about this particular problem is that many of the asides the story is "distracted" by actually serve Franco's character and afford him an opportunity to do some really charming, interesting work. If only the writers (including King) and editors could have found a better, more streamlined way to integrate those elements, then the discussion around this miniseries might have to do with it potentially being one of the better adaptations of King's work period.Still, despite its occasional clumsiness, 11.22.63 is an entertaining effort from Hulu and one that will hopefully lead to bigger and better things from the streaming service in the future.-11.22.63 continues next Monday with 'The Kill Floor.'Photos: Hulu

Saw II-IV helmer Darren Lynn Bousman - who's also known for directing the cult horror/rock musical, Repo! The Genetic Opera - intends to scare the socks off moviegoers with his new supernatural horror flick 11-11-11: a thriller based on the beliefs of the 11:11 movement.Previously-released teasers for Bousman's film have primarily focused on playing up the ominous implications of its premise (ie. that the appearance of the number 11 signifies an attempt by spiritual beings to communicate with regular people) - and featuring flashes of creepily unnerving imagery. The new full-length trailer for 11-11-11 doesn't vary from that approach.One thing that 11-11-11 does seem to have going for it is Bousman's decision to rely heavily on practical tools (costumes, monster makeup, etc.) and actual spooky locations for atmospheric effect. While that move was probably in part due to the writer/director having a comparatively small budget to work with, it nonetheless allows the film to visually harken back to menacing old-school horror tales like The Exorcist - and not come off as just another cheesy CGI-fest in these early previews.Here is an official synopsis for 11-11-11:In the film, after the tragic death of his wife and child, famed American author Joseph Crone (Timothy Gibbs) travels from the United States to Barcelona, Spain to reunite with his estranged brother Samuel (Michael Landes) and dying father, Richard (Denis Rafter). However, fate has a different plan for Joseph as his life becomes plagued with strange happenings, and the constant sightings of the number 11. Curiosity quickly turns to obsession, and Joseph soon realizes that this number holds a horrific meaning not only to himself but possibly to all of religion. Isolated in a foreign country with only the support of his companion, Sadie, Joseph soon realizes that 11/11/11 is more than just a date, it's a WARNING!Now check out the new 11-11-11 trailer below:This new 11-11-11 theatrical preview does a good job of teasing the film's actual plot in a fashion that gets your attention, but doesn't reveal too many (if any) of the film's secrets. While the recently-released Paranormal Activity 3 left many a moviegoer annoyed by its somewhat controversial marketing scheme, 11-11-11 appears to be much more straightforward in its approach. That is to say, the final product will definitely boast all the macabre visuals and narrative twists hinted at in its trailers.Unfortunately, there seems to be a strong possibility that 11-11-11 will amount to a hokey wannabe scarefest that looks and feels mostly like a glorified direct-to-DVD horror B-movie (re: cheap). That's not to mention, Bousman also doesn't exactly boast the greatest track record as a filmmaker, seeing how he's better known for crafting graphic - but not chilling - horror flicks.On the other hand: there is definitely an audience which would go for a weirdly (accidental) campy supernatural thriller. So even if 11-11-11 fails to be legitimately scary, that doesn't mean it will be devoid of any entertainment value.-11-11-11 is scheduled to hit U.S. theaters on (you guessed it) November 11th, 2011.Source: Yahoo!

Ending a television series after four seasons is “bittersweet,” according to 12 Monkeys star Aaron Stanford. The actor is just a week away from seeing his SYFY show reach its time-hopping conclusion as the four-week final season marathon marches toward the finish line. But while it’s always nice to be a part of a series that gets to tell a complete story from start to finish, Stanford says that there are other emotions that come along with it, and some of them might even creep into the actors’ performances. The chance to take part in a series finale is nothing new for Stanford. Before making the move to SYFY, he co-starred alongside Maggie Q on The CW’s Nikita for four seasons. Despite his familiarity with final seasons, Stanford’s experience is nevertheless a mix of emotions since, as he puts it, he’s “saying goodbye to [his] family.”Stanford talked about bringing 12 Monkeys to a close in a recent interview with Screen Rant, where he discussed the amount of time an actor spends with the crew and fellow cast members, and how bringing that to an end can be challenging. Stanford said:“It's bittersweet. Obviously you're always happy when you can tell a story completely from beginning to end, and tell it in a satisfying way where you're able to make yourself happy and make the audience happy. It's gratifying to be able to do something like that and see something through from beginning to end. On the bitter side, you're saying goodbye to your family. You know these are people that you work with and spend every day of the week for between 14 and 16 hours. You share your life with them, and it's tough when it comes to an end.”A sense of finality has been present throughout the fourth season, particularly when James and Katarina (Barbara Sukowa) venture back to the beginning of their time travel adventure only to encounter themselves. Stanford says that feeling likely came through in the performances as a byproduct of the actors knowing they are working with one another for the last time. “What you're reading there is probably what we were projecting as people and as actors. There was a feeling, for me anyway, throughout the entire final season, there was that feeling every time we shot in a location where 'This is the last time we're gonna shoot here.' Or This is the last scene that I'm going to have with this person. Those things had a weight and a gravity to them. I think it just ended up coming across naturally in the performance. And I think it really works for the story, but it was a pretty natural process.”Next: 12 Monkeys’ Final Season: James Cole Is A Man With ‘Everything To Lose’12 Monkeys concludes next Friday with ‘The Beginning: Parts 1 & 2’ on SYFY.

So far, it’s been something of a wild ride, with James and Cassie heading off on separate missions with wildly different objectives, only to be reunited once James confirmed he was destined to play a role in the events of the series. And just recently the series introduced a whopping twist that will have people talking. Twist or no, however, the game is coming to an end, and Stanford says James’ current predicament have raised the stakes to a higher degree than they ever have been before. In an interview with Screen Rant, Stanford discussed the final season storyline and how it unfolds in such a way as to give the upcoming finale and the story of James Cole much higher stakes than previously thought. Stanford said: “I think he is, at this point in the season, he's very determined to see things through to the end, but he's of a very different mind than he was at the beginning of the seres, where really he was on a suicide mission. He wanted basically for it to be over for him. He was a man with nothing to lose and was more than willing to do that, and at this point, in the story he's gained so much and now he has everything to lose, so the stakes are much, much higher for him at this point.”The series is set to wrap up next week with the final two episodes (hopefully) delivering the ending fans have  been waiting for. SYFY has been experimenting with how it delivers 12 Monkeys these last two seasons, and so far the four-week marathon has made for fun Friday night viewings. With just one week to go, it will be interesting to see how Stanford’s assessment of the series’ high stakes plays out. Next: GLOW Season 2 Review: Maybe The Most Fun You Can Have Watching TV Right Now12 Monkeys will conclude next Friday with ‘The Beginning: Part 1 & 2’ on SYFY.

This Week in TV:Sophie Skelton joins Outlander; Billions renewed for second season; Woody Allen casts Miley Cyrus; Daniel Zovatto joins Fear the Walking Dead; 12 Monkeys season 2 trailer; A Series of Unfortunate Events casting; and new Bates Motel promo.-Sophie Skelton Joins OutlanderOutlander season 2 has found its Brianna in Sophie Skelton (Ren). Brianna is the daughter of time-travelers Claire and Jamie Fraser, described as a striking redhead who is intelligent beyond her years. She embodies the wit of her mother, along with the trademark stubbornness of the Fraser family. Though Skelton's relatively new to television, the actress is a trained singer and ballet dancer and has appeared in numerous stage productions, including West Side Story and Les Mis.The second season will see Claire and Jamie exploring France, trying to infiltrate the Jacobite rebellion in an attempt to prevent a disastrous battle from ever occurring. The two must face the weight of the decision to alter their future, presenting unexpected problems in their relationship. The series is based on the best-selling books of Diana Gabaldon, with the second season seemingly drawing inspiration from the fourth book in the series - "Drums of Autumn."Outlander season 2 premieres in April 2016.Source: TheWrapBillions Already Renewed for Season 2Though the series just premiered on January 17th, Showtime has already renewed its drama Billions for season 2.

There's been no news about the project since its announcement, though Allen confirmed making the jump to television was more difficult than he expected.It seems that the creator has now made some progress on the untitled series, as he has cast two leads to star alongside him in the show. The first is Elaine May, an actress he's worked with previously on Small Time crooks. The second casting announcement was far more surprising.

The final season of SYFY’s 12 Monkeys has a premiere date and a new teaser trailer, revealing that the show’s final go-round will be a four-week event. The event will deliver the entire 11-episode season in the span of a month, with the series finale consisting of a two-hour episode that will aim to wrap the series and its various loose strings up once and for all. It’s a tall order for any series, but an especially tall one considering how intricate the show’s various plot lines and timelines have become in just three seasons. No wonder it will have been more than a year since the show aired its most recent season finale.With the news of the season 4 “event,” the last two seasons of 12 Monkeys have become about as noteworthy for their unconventional distribution as they are (or will be) for the events that will or already have transpired in them. If you recall, the entirety of season 3 was delivered by SYFY in the span of a single weekend, turning it into an unlikely Netflix-style binge-watch session (or as close to one that you can get from a cable channel still looking to rake in some advertising dollars) that may or may not have been to your liking — depending on how much mileage you get from such things. But now season 4 is officially on its way, and although it will bring about an end to the series, in a new statement from SYFY, the network says a four-season run was always the plan. You can read the statement below: “Originally envisioned as a four-part story, in Season 4 James Cole and Dr. Cassandra Railly set out on an epic quest, traveling further back in time than they have ever been before. According to legend, their only hope lies with a weapon capable of stopping the Witness for good. But they'll soon discover that in order to win the final battle and save time itself, they will have to make the ultimate sacrifice.”The downside to bingeing a new season so quickly is now it feels like a lifetime since season 3 was on the air, making some of the specific details about what transpired a little foggy. Good thing there’s still plenty of time between now and when season 4 airs, so you can re-binge the third season (or the entire series) before diving into the final arc. Next: Every Network TV Show Cancellation & Renewal Of 2018 (So Far)12 Monkeys season 4 premieres Friday, June 15 @8pm on SYFY.

It’s hard to think of another sub-genre that presents more delightfully convoluted, brain-melting storytelling possibilities than time travel. The paradoxical nature of the narrative device central to these stories is, in part, what’s so appealing about them, as characters try and fail time and again to break a never ending circle of actions and consequences, or learn too late how one small deviation in the past can upend the future in dramatic fashion. But whatever the approach, tales traversing time tend to always find a way to capture the imagination, and at the start of its final season, SYFY’s 12 Monkeys demonstrates why it’s not just a great example of a time travel story told very well, but one of the best science fiction series on TV at the moment. For three seasons, 12 Monkeys has taken full advantage of the narrative possibilities of time travel, expanding its story of the army of the 12 Monkeys beyond a group of radicals hell bent on releasing a human-killing plague to that of a clandestine organization determined to end time itself. Those three seasons have seemingly packed five lifetime’s worth of living into the story of its two leads, James Cole (Aaron Stanford) and Cassandra Railly (Amanda Schull), as they have bounced back and forth throughout time in an effort to first stop the plague from happening and then to prevent the coming of the end of time. Through it all, they’ve fallen in love, had a child, Athlan, met the adult version of said child (James Callis), and watched him vanish before their eyes. They’ve also jumped forward and backward in time so often that, as is made clear in a last-ditch effort to avoid Olivia (Alisen Down) and the time-traveling fortress called Titan, they are inevitably going to wind up chasing themselves, a not too subtle nod to the image of the ouroboros, or the snake devouring its own tail, which takes on increasing significance this season. As is so often the case with most series, the biggest question is whether or not the show has an ending in mind or if the series was one intended to run in perpetuity. 12 Monkeys could easily be the latter, but its plot machinations over the past three seasons are such that it clearly favors the former. That is: When it comes time to deliver an ending to 12 Monkeys it’s reasonable to be confident that the show knows what it’s doing. And from the season 4 premiere, cleverly titled ‘The End,’ 12 Monkeys sets it cast of characters on a number of divergent paths that, in some cases, mirror where they were at the beginning of the series, while also acknowledging all they have experienced between then and now. Because SYFY has spent the last two seasons tweaking the delivery method of 12 Monkeys, the final season is another marathon, albeit one that runs for four weeks rather than a single weekend. Still, the season begins with a three-hour premiere, consisting of ‘The End,’ ‘Ouroboros,’ and ’45 RPM.’ That’s a little easier to handle than last year’s four-episode per-night, three-day binge, and it definitely encourages a greater conversation around these final episodes (batches or otherwise). The first batch, then, is more or less a primer on the beginning of the end, starting with… well, ‘The End.’ The opener ostensibly boils down to one of the things 12 Monkeys does very well, which is pit its protagonists against unbeatable odds, only to have them escape by the skin of their teeth. In the final season that tried-and-true formula does more than generate high stakes from the get-go; it repositions the characters throughout time, giving James, Cassandra, Katarina (Barbara Sukowa), Jennifer (Emily Hampshire), and Deacon (Todd Stashwick) a variety of potential storylines that, divergent as they appear, can only be headed toward the same end point. What that end point will eventually turn out to be is anyone’s guess, but it’s made clear fairly early on that it is James’s destiny to save the world, as evidenced by Conleth Hill’s (Game of Thrones) appearance as a member of a secret organization meant to deliver a device to James that’s — you guessed it — an ouroboros. That the series would find itself careening toward the fulfillment James's destiny isn’t really all that surprising, though it raises a lot of questions that hopefully the next three weeks worth of episodes will find satisfactory answers to. What’s more surprising is the way in which the first three episodes put Cassie and James on such different paths, and how those paths speak to the emotional response each has to meeting their child and watching him vanish into thin air. Cassie’s brief turn as a vengeful mother hell bent on assassinating Olivia makes for an exciting hour of television that demonstrates the degree to which the series has changed her from the woman she was in season 1. The same goes for James, as his once robotic “finish the mission” ethos has become entangled in that tricky thing called compassion, as he ventures to find Jennifer, and in doing so discovers the ouroboros and his “destiny.”Whether in its efforts to break the twisty narrative loop it has created for itself or find the beginning of the end by going all the way back to the beginning of the story, 12 Monkeys season 4 manages to deliver enough surprises (and a surprising amount of laughs) early on in its run that, even though the end is just three weeks away, the end feels as though it may be one no one saw coming. Next: Luke Cage Season 2 Review: An Engaging, Satisfying Crime Drama12 Monkeys continues next Friday with ‘Legacy’, ‘Die Glocke,’ and ‘After’ starting @8pm on SYFY.

A new teaser trailer and poster have been released for season 4 of Syfy's time travel series, 12 Monkeys. The show's final season will air in a four-week event. The season, which will consist of 11 episodes, will air over the course of a month. The series will conclude with a two-hour finale.Though this schedule may seem unusual, fans of the series will recall that the broadcast schedule for season 3 of 12 Monkeys was even less conventional. All 10 episodes aired in a three-day weekend event in May, beginning with four episodes on a Friday. This approach was surprising, as it relied on DVR viewing levels and fans being willing to binge the series in one weekend.Related: The Expanse Canceled At Syfy After Three SeasonsAn ominous new teaser trailer for season 4 reveals that "the end is coming", and gives fans brief glimpses of the Red Forest, the Witness, and Titan. The teaser ends with someone waving a bloodied medieval sword at Cole (Aaron Stanford). Additionally, 12 Monkeys showrunner Terry Matalas tweeted out a poster that shows Cole standing in front of the time machine. Interestingly, the background shows the machine exuding a bright red light, opposed to the blue light fans generally see when the machine is activated.June 15th on @Syfy #12Monkeys pic.twitter.com/PQl9bexJRwRed is a symbolic color in the world of 12 Monkeys, as it is often used to signify that an object has been affected by a temporal disturbance. In the season 2 finale, a tree with red leaves was a sign that the world was about to end.The SDCC 2017 trailer for 12 Monkeys season 4 previewed some of the challenges Cole, Cassie (Amanda Schull), Jones (Barbara Sukowa), Deacon (Todd Stashwick), and Jennifer (Emily Hamsphire) will be dealing with in the upcoming season. We know from the trailer that the characters will travel back further than ever by visiting time periods such as the Old West and the Middle Ages, as indicated by the sword in the teaser trailer.Based on the events of the season 3 finale, the new season may dive deeper into Cole's role in saving the timeline. A flashback to his youth hinted that his part in the story was known to his mother since he was a child. In the flashback, Cole's father reads a story about a serpent eating its tail, which is somehow linked to the Witness' plan to destroy time. The story about the serpent was the focus of previous trailers and promotional material.More: Nightflyers Teaser Trailer: You Can't Escape George R.R.

The fourth season of 12 Monkeys promises plenty of time-travel action and drama as the series takes the characters further back into the past than ever before. This new trailer gives us a glimpse at what the characters will be up to when the series returns for its final season.The trailer highlights scenes set in different time periods, including the Old West and World War II. At the 12 Monkeys panel, showrunner Terry Matalas also teased that the show is "going to get medieval." There's also a strong focus on the show's main villain, the Witness, who was shockingly revealed to be Olivia (Alisen Down) in the season 3 finale. Olivia had been manipulating the characters throughout the series, and even pretended to be an ally in season 3. The trailer lets us see Olivia as she embraces her identity as the Witness, no longer seeking to hide her true intentions.Right away, the trailer dives deep into the story of "the serpent" that was told to young Cole by his father during the season 3 finale when Cole discovered a note written by his mother. The tale of the serpent that eats his own tail appears to be a metaphor for time, and the demon encountered by the serpent is the Witness, who seeks to destroy time.Though the trailer provides us with a good sample of the action we can expect from the ten-episode final chapter of the series, not much can be learned about what's in store for the characters as they deal with the repercussions of their battle with the Witness. The team was torn apart over the revelation that their greatest enemy was the son of Cole (Aaron Stanford) and Cassie (Amanda Schull). Their decision to hide it from the rest of the team, as well as their decision to protect their son despite his threat to time itself, only made things worse.Just when their problems seemed irreconcilable, a stunning new twist put them all on the same side again. However, previous seasons indicate that situations on the show will never be that black-and-white. This was noted during the panel when it was stated that Cole and Cassie would have "a philosophical disagreement."One thing we can be sure about is that the characters still have a long way to go, not only concerning their quest to stop the Witness, but also in working together as a team again. Matalas says that season 4 is about family. The characters have "lost the war and it will get much worse."Next: 12 Monkeys Season 3 Makes For a Compelling Weekend BingeSource: SYFY

[This is a review of the series premiere of 12 Monkeys. There will be SPOILERS.]-Since the Ronald D. Moore's acclaimed re-imagining of Battlestar Galatica ended back in 2009, the SyFy network has been in a constant state of identity crisis. Fans of the science fiction genre were craving more shows like BSG, but would the network take the easy way out by focusing on reality TV series like Ghost Hunters, or would this niche cable channel dare to go where no channel had gone before?12 Monkeys, alongside other new series like Dominion, Helix and Defiance, proves that SyFy is committed to journeying down avenues other networks might not dare tread. Like Moore's new take on BSG, 12 Monkeys takes a different approach to the iconic cult favorite directed by Terry Gilliam in 1995. The essence of the nearly 20-year-old film is still there, but creators and Terra Nova alums Terry Matalas and Travis Fickett are not beholden to it. Basically, these two mad geniuses can do what they want.The freedom that SyFy has blessed Matalas and Fickett with has allowed them to create an exciting sci-fi tapestry filled to the brim with time travel, paradoxes and post-apocalyptic futures for us to explore. What more could a geek want, right? Sure, those tropes alone won't succeed without a strong enough story and cast to hold them up. Fortunately, the entire team behind this show has excelled on all fronts, starting with its small but diverse ensemble.Amanda Schull (Pretty Little Liars) plays our heroine Dr. Cassandra Railly, who is a talented, ahead-of-her-time scientist who knows too much for her own good. The gorgeous Hawaii-born actress is a force to be reckoned with, even when she's playing the "innocent card" in tough situations. In many ways, her character falls into that usual category of a somewhat ordinary person thrown into an unimaginable circumstance, but it's her onscreen chemistry with co-lead Aaron Stanford (X-Men 2), that elevates her performance.Yes, for fans of Bryan Singer's X-Men franchise, the leading man in this series is none other than Pyro himself. Stanford is the brooding time traveler named James Cole. Like Pyro, Cole is a character whose difficult to classify - is he good or is he bad? Perhaps that's too simple a question, since an ambiguous character can at times be the most intriguing. His understanding of the plague that kills seven billion people in 2017 is not as thorough as he once thought.Cole and the organization he works for believe that by killing Leland Goines in 2015, they will prevent the terrible outbreak of 2017 from ever happening. Like time travel, even murdering someone is not an exact science and we soon learn of a greater mystery toward the end of the episode.Apparently, there are others responsible for the end of all things called the Army of the 12 Monkeys. At one paradoxical point in the premiere, Leland tells Cole that they met each other in the late 1980s. Cole has no recollection of that meeting taking place, so one would have to assume that we will see more of the talented Zelijko Ivanek (True Blood) in a future episode.12 Monkeys is a rarity in that its mysteries are just as interesting as its characters. Both Railly and Cole are people you'll want to get to know more, along with an assortment of other cast members that we only get a glimpse of. Most notably, Goines' estranged daughter Jennifer (Emily Hampshire), who we see drawing a picture of a Monkey in what looks to be a mental hospital. It will be interesting to see what side she chooses to fight for. Hopefully, this series will be a success for SyFy, allowing the network to take more risks with future projects.So what did you think of SyFy's newest drama? For fans of the film, did you like the differences, or were they a distraction? Stay tuned to see what happens next.12 Monkeys continues with 'Mentally Divergent' next Friday @9pm on SyFy. Check out a trailer for the series below:

Few things are more difficult than choosing your favorite episode of The Simpsons, at least in my opinion. Alas, one of those things is choosing your favorite Treehouse of Horror episode of The Simpsons. While I adore Treehouse of Horror II ("Lisa's Nightmare," "Bart's Nightmare," and "Homer's Nightmare"), Treehouse of Horror IV ("The Devil and Homer Simpson," "Terror at 5 1/2 Feet," and "Bart Simpson's Dracula"), as well as Treehouse of Horror V ("The Shinning," "Time and Punishment," and "Nightmare Cafeteria"), I'll always have a special place in my heart for Treehouse of Horror III.Each story in this anthology is told by one of the Simpsons at Bart and Lisa's Halloween party. "Clown Without Pity," as told by Grandpa Simpson, is about a Krusty the Klown doll that relentlessly tries to kill Homer, a la Chucky. "King Homer," as told by Marge Simpson, is basically King Kong if all the characters were replaced by Simpsons characters (You can probably guess who Homer plays). Last, "Dial 'Z' for Zombies," as told by Bart Simpson (in an Alex DeLarge from A Clockwork Orange costume), is about Bart and Lisa accidentally raising the dead and having to deal with the undead consequences.Of those three, my favorite is "Zombies," and here's one of a million reasons why:Frankly, if that clip doesn't warm the cockles of your heart with all sorts of Halloween spirit, I don't know what will.

It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown!
 




















I’m pretty sure it’s illegal in 40 of the 48 Continental United States to leave It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown! off of any "Best" list pertaining to Halloween episodes or specials - so here it is! Front and center!
Needless to say, The Great Pumpkin is a classic for a reason -- one that has been beloved for decades and will likely go on being beloved for many to come. Like its Christmas counterpart, no Halloween is truly complete without at least a single viewing.
The bulk of the story sees the typically wise Linus van Pelt faithfully awaiting the arrival of the Great Pumpkin -- basically the Halloween equivalent of Santa Claus -- at the town pumpkin patch the night of Halloween. None of Linus' friends believe him and they tend to mock his insistence that the Great Pumpkin exists. Hence Linus utters the famous line: "There are three things I have learned never to discuss with people: religion, politics, and the Great Pumpkin."
I remember watching this as a kid and always wishing there were a Halloween equivalent of Santa. But maybe, instead of just bringing toys like Santa does, he'd scare the crap out of you in really strange and disturbing ways - like a sanctioned version of Jack Skellington from A Nightmare Before Christmas.
Check out a clip below of Charlie Brown getting nothing but rocks whilst trick-or-treating:
httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tIhwITwhSg
Apparently, seeing Charlie Brown receive rock after rock after rock instead of candy affected viewers so much that they actually sent bags and boxes of candy to Charles Schulz "just for Charlie Brown." Which is kind of ironic, considering Charlie Brown, sort of like the Great Pumpkin, is a fictional being.

Boo to You, Too! Winnie the Pooh
 




















I'm sure many of you are wondering why Boo to You, Too! Winnie the Pooh -- the Pooh Halloween special that aired on CBS in 1996 - is on this list of TV episodes/specials to get you in the mood for Halloween. Well, if that is indeed the case, I submit that you, sir or madam, have never actually seen Boo to You, Too! Winnie the Pooh. Because if you had, you'd know that Boo to You is positively dripping with enjoyably spooky atmosphere, creativity, and a childlike whimsy found in few fictional tales involving October 31st. Isn't that what Halloween is all about?
Here's the opening voiceover, narrated by David Ogden Stiers, to give you an idea of the tone:
"Once each year, as October breezes bluster, there comes a most particular and most peculiar night. An anxious sort of night, when the dark grows a little more so. A jittery sort of night, where nothing is quite as it was. A night called -- Halloween."
Also, check out one of the musical clips below:
httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnj3LDC4Zj8
Briefly, the plot of Boo to You follows the various Pooh characters as they try to help Piglet overcome his overwhelming fear of Halloween. Boo to You, Too! Winnie the Pooh is to Halloween what Mickey's Christmas Carol is to Christmas, in my opinion. Yeah, it's that good.

Like The Gold Rush, The Maltese Falcon, and Casablanca before it, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to stand the test of time. Which is why, in 2001, the U.S Library of Congress deemed it “culturally, historically, and/or aesthetically significant” (in my opinion, all of the above) before preserving it forever via the National Film Registry.The film combines the amazing atmosphere and cinematography of Universal’s Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, and The Wolfman, as well as the titular characters from those films (or in the case of Frankenstein, the titular character’s monster), with the still hilarious antics of William “Bud” Abbott and Lou Costello. Every monster movie team-up since was probably inspired by this little ditty, up to and including Freddy VS. Jason.Check out the trailer below:httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg5N9FJc__QBasically, the plot of the film is "One stupid guy and one really, really stupid guy almost get killed by all the Universal monsters over and over again – however, due to their hilarious naiveté, they manage to stave off execution." Simple, yes, but endlessly hilarious and fun - and no Halloween is complete without it.-The Monster Squad is by no means a perfect film. But what it lacks in finesse, it more than makes up for with heart, awesome child actors, a dog that can high-five, Rick Baker special effects, and politically incorrect humor as provided by screenwriter Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Iron Man 3).The plot of the film sees the infamous Universal Monsters – Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, the Mummy, the Wolfman, as well as the Creature from the Black Lagoon – attempt to take over the world, as per usual. But who’s there to stop them? The Monster Squad - a rag-tag band of pre-teens with a strange affinity for everything monster-related.Check out the trailer below:httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBG29nM_uEgIn many ways, The Monster Squad is the like a twelve-year-old’s version of Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (only the protagonists are more competent), with young actor performances reminiscent of (but not as serious as) the ones from Stand by Me and E.T.FYI: A remake of The Monster Squad  is currently in the planning stages and is being produced by Rob Cohen, otherwise known as the director of the upcoming xXx: The Return of Xander Cage. So, uhm, keep your eye out for that one, I guess?-I would be remiss if I didn’t include John Carpenter’s Halloween on this list of films to get you in the mood for Halloween.It probably goes without saying that this 1978 classic – more so than even Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho, Bob Clark's Black Christmas, or Tobe Hooper’s Texas Chainsaw Massacre – created the slasher genre as we know it today. There would be no Friday the 13th, Prom Night, My Bloody Valentine, or Scream films without the critically-acclaimed and commercially successful Michael Myers vehicle.Check out the original trailer below:Everybody knows the story: Wholesome Laurie Strode is innocently babysitting children and twiddling her thumbs while all her promiscuous neighborhood pals are being chopped up by a somewhat human version of the Boogeyman with William Shatner’s face for a mask. Sort of.
As far as horror movies go, this one is a freaking grand-slam. Forget the stupid, shock-laden torture-pornography that kids love today – Halloween was all about subtle and deliberate scares on top of an iconic excellent synthesized score by Mr. Carpenter himself. Do yourself a favor and watch Halloween on Halloween - or before.

In case you've been living in a cave or exploring an ancient tomb for the past week, you should know that Disney has announced that there's to be a new Indiana Jones film released in 2019, directed by Steven Spielberg and once again starring Harrison Ford. The news was met with a mixture of reactions, some incredibly excited that Harrison Ford is dusting off the hat and the whip again and others more cautious with the wounds of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull opening anew.Will Indiana Jones 5 be the Indy adventure we all hope it will be? Only time will tell, but it could do a lot worse than avoiding the pitfalls Crystal Skull fell into and reading our 12 Reasons Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Screwed Up Indiana Jones.Click the button below to start this article in quick view8 years after Raiders of the Lost Ark came out, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg decided to send the beloved character of Indiana Jones on his last crusade. The film dealt with Indy's father issues as well as the quest for the Holy Grail. By the end of the film, the Grail has been found, Indy had reconnected with his father and our heroes galloped off into the sunset, like the classic cowboys of old. The final shot was a perfect way to close the book on the adventures of Henry Jones Jr.Kingdom of the Crystal Skull doesn't do enough to justify reopening that book. We can only start to reflect on how good a story was once it's over. Last Crusade was the perfect end point for the character, having our hero work out his family issues and have achieved the literal Holy Grail of his career. The end point of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has Indy getting married and presumably settling down. Here's hoping Indy 5 has a better conclusion that that.Indiana Jones films are pretty simple chase affairs. Indy is told of a powerful ancient relic, finds out that some bad dudes want to get their hands on said relic and then he endeavours to stop them and make sure that the power doesn't fall into the wrong hands. On paper, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull follows that formula.However, the film weighs itself down with needless story baggage. For example, there is no point to the FBI subplot whatsoever. Indy gets hauled in by government agents who suspect him of being a Communist (the film being set at the height of the McCarthy era witch hunts). They also ransack his office and cause Jim Broadbent's Dean to resign from his post. Once the film gets underway, the FBI are forgotten about. At the end, Dean Stanforth seems to still be working at Marshall College having hired Indy as the associate dean and everything's back to normal. There are numerous bits like this that distract from the main narrative and make the story baggy.There's a popular saying that a film is only as good as its villain. While not necessarily true in all cases, it certainly applies to the previous Indy films. Belloq and Major Toht headed up Raiders of the Lost Ark, Mola Ram was Temple of Doom's baddie and both Walter Donovan and Elsa Schneider shared evil duties in Last Crusade. These are all memorable villains with clear motivations and reasons for us to hate them.Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has Irina Spalko, a highly decorated Soviet scientist and military officer, obsessed with using the power of the crystal skull to aid the Soviet Union win the Cold War. There isn't much about her that's particularly villainous or charismatic. The overall plan is vague too. There are mentions of brainwashing, but it's not expanded on enough. We know that the skull has weird powers and sent John Hurt's Oxley crazy, but we're never given any real indication of the consequences of the skull falling into Soviet hands. It's hard to get invested in Indy preventing disaster when we don't really know what that disaster would be. It's also tough to cheer a hero besting a bad guy you don't care about.Big action set-pieces are a hallmark of the Indy series. For decades, audiences have come to known the franchise as a place for globetrotting, adventure and death defying feats. The giant boulder rolling after Indy at the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark is an iconic moment of cinema and a pop cultural touchstone.With all that in mind, it's baffling that Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has weak, run-of-the-mill action. Apart from a half-decent bike chase around the college campus, the action is mediocre, soulless and CGI heavy. There's a chase through the Peruvian jungle that has all the danger and tension drained thanks to weak CGI work. Mutt swordfighting Spalko astride two speeding vehicles is ridiculous, but could have been fun. However, the scene is so obviously computer generated you're made very much aware that it was shot on a soundstage, ruining the immersion completely. The earlier Indy films were triumphs of classic stuntwork and it's disheartening to see Crystal Skull move so far away from that.The Indy franchise has never shied away from the darker side of things. From the melting heads in Raiders to nearly everything about Temple of Doom and Donovan's demise in Last Crusade, there are some gruesome and disturbing things contained within the first three films.Put simply, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull plays it too safe. It feels like a concession to being family-friendly, which is something the series never really was. To make everything practically edgeless distances the series from its pulp roots, not to mention the other films in the series. People are shot off-camera, there's little to no focus on injury and most of the deaths are cartoony and over-the-top. Even the themes are less mature. Raiders was an exploration of faith, greed and even had some Promethean parallels. Crystal Skull is just a wacky adventure with no real subtext. It all feels toothless and unworthy of the Indiana Jones title.Since the 1990s, CGI has become an increasingly big part of how blockbusters deliver huge spectacle and action. As with any tool, it's up to the craftsman to know how to use it and the limitations of it. Some of the best computer generated work in more modern films goes unnoticed because that's exactly what it's designed to do.When it comes to effects, there are some filmmakers that tend to use a sledgehammer when a chisel would have sufficed. Unfortunately Crystal Skull suffers from the sledgehammer approach. The human eye is great at detecting fakery and Indy 4 is lousy with it. Entire locations are greenscreened and action sequences have an unpleasant blurry quality to them because either the effects work or technology wasn't up to scratch. To be fair, the older films used miniatures and matte paintings to the same end, but they were used sparingly. Locations and stunts were kept as real as possible and as a result, they still hold up today. Crystal Skull has managed to age badly in eight years.Indiana Jones is an archaeologist. He's a learned man with both a knowledge of and a respect for the past. It's these things that make him successful in his career. He's also tough and more than capable in a fight, but his brawn is always secondary to his brains. Part of the fun of the films is watching Indy figure out some historical puzzle. He works out the correct burial site of the Ark of the Covenant in Raiders and solves many mysteries his father couldn't in Last Crusade.Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has Indy deciphering notes left by Oxley. They used a similar set-up in Last Crusade when Indy had his father's notebook, but that was for a good character reason, to show Indy was still living in his father's shadow. Figuring out the scrawlings of a mad professor doesn't have the same impact as working out an ancient clue or riddle. It makes Indy seem passive in his own adventure as he's following, rather than leading.Indy has had some great characters tag along on his adventures. You'd have a tough job to find someone who didn't like Sallah , Marcus Brody or Henry Jones Snr. Even Short Round has his fans. Indy needs a reliable, likable helper of some kind. It keeps him relatable and also gives Indy a reason to explain his methods to them and, by proxy, us the audience.Crystal Skull has Mac and Mutt. Mac isn't a classic sidekick. He's a traitor. He turns on Indy at the start of the film only to explain later that he's a double agent. Near the end, he reveals that he lied and was always working for the Soviets. That's all there is to the character. Any history the two have is only given lip service and it's hard to figure out why Indy would trust him after his first betrayal. To be fooled twice makes him look stupid. Mutt isn't as bad, but the film doesn't flesh him out nearly enough and it seems in two minds whether to set him up as Indy's successor or not.Marion Ravenwood is a great female lead in Raiders of the Lost Ark. She's a firecracker. She's tough as nails and feisty and more than a match for Indy. Before the film, we learn that she fell for Indy pretty hard when she was a teenager and the two had a relationship than wrecked Indy's friendship with her father. Indy left, leaving Marion devastated. The two rekindled that relationship during the events of Raiders but she wasn't mentioned after that.Marion makes her reappearance in Crystal Skull as Mutt's mother. Her and Indy start bickering immediately. Gone is the Marion of old and in her place is a softly chiding motherly type. Is it realistic that someone would change in 25 years, especially after becoming a parent? Absolutely. It is fitting for the series or interesting in the slightest? Nope. There's nothing for her to actually do in the film. Marion may as well have been a brand new character that Indy had had an off-screen relationship with.According to Steven Spielberg, George Lucas had been pushing for aliens to appear in an Indiana Jones film since the '90s. Spielberg, having done Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, was reluctant and there was a creative stalemate for years. When it came time to scripting Crystal Skull, Lucas again campaigned for aliens and Spielberg relented.Extraterrestrials aren't the weirdest thing to appear in series dealing with curses, ancient power and the supernatural, but they don't work in Crystal Skull. The film wants to be a setting appropriate '50 B-movie but also a classic '30s serial- style caper at the same time. It's an odd mix of genres that don't mesh together. For some, it was a silly plot point too far.No one is claiming Indiana Jones films are documentaries. The established series had its moments of Hollywood physics and loopy logic. You just need to look at the inflatable raft escape from a crashing airplane in Temple of Doom to know that Indy and physics don't always see eye-to-eye.Having said that, Crystal Skull perhaps takes things too far. Aside from the aliens, there are many things that don't quite gel. There's the infamous “nuking the fridge” scene, which despite some physicists saying that Indy could have survived, still sticks out like a sore thumb. Perhaps the worst offender is the scene where Marion drives the gang off a cliff, only to have a tree flex and carry them safely to the water, before twanging back and swatting some bad guys off the cliff face.These scenes carry no tension because its clear the film will just find some convenience to aid our heroes. It's unsatisfying and a little intellectually insulting. Even cartoons exist on some kind of logic.Indiana Jones was created as a sort of American answer to James Bond. He's a fantasy figure. People either want to be him or want to sleep with him. He's an ideal man and the perfect audience projection vessel to carry us through dangerous and exciting adventures.While it's always great to see Harrison Ford don the fedora, having Indy as an old man goes against the wide appeal of the character. Pulp novel heroes weren't written to be particularly complex. They beat up the bad guys and got the girl. Crystal Skull moves away from this by giving us an older Indy with emotional baggage, which brings the character out of the fun fantasy world and into more realistic territory. The James Bond series changes Bonds once an actor gets too old for this very reason. This may be one of the crucial reasons that Crystal Skull doesn't feel like a proper Indiana Jones movie.However, now that the character has been written to be a little deeper, perhaps Indy 5 will take him in a new direction that manages to please fans of the fantasy element and people who want more complex, realistic characters.Making Kingdom of the Crystal Skull may not have been the worst idea, but some of the choices made in the film were truly baffling. The fact that both Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg are getting another crack of the whip could rights some of the wrongs of Crystal Skull.Whether Indiana Jones 5 is a final chapter or the start of a new series remains to be seen. One thing is crystal clear though: Indiana Jones means an incredible amount to people. Here's hoping the new film does the character and series justice.

Newcomers tried, but none of them were unable to unseat The Rock from the top of the box office charts.Coming in first is Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle with $20 million in its fifth weekend. The adventure film continued its dominance of the marketplace, raising its domestic total to $316.9 million. Before its run is complete, it should be able to work its way into the top 5 on the 2017 charts.In second is the new war drama 12 Strong (read our review), which brought in $16.5 million during its first three days. The film was bolstered by a strong cast (including Chris Hemsworth and Michael Shannon), as well as an incredible true story about real-life American heroes. However, those factors weren't enough to help it break out of its niche, and 12 Strong had difficulties appealing beyond its target audience. The most likely culprit there is the lukewarm critical reception, painting the film has an above-average, but unremarkable, movie. Its production budget was just $35 million, though, so it stands a chance at turning a profit if it performs well overseas.The #3 movie is Den of Thieves with $15.3 million. Like 12 Strong, the latest crime thriller boasted a star-studded ensemble and interesting concept, but was hamstrung by uninspired reviews. Many passed Den of Thieves off as a carbon copy of Michael Mann's superior classic, Heat, which hurt this film's prospects. However, Den of Thieves was moderately budgeted at $30 million, so it could end up being a success if it has legs. There won't be much in the way of direct competition for its target audience for the next several weeks.In fourth is The Post with $12.1 million. Steven Spielberg's historical drama is now up to $45.1 million domestically as it rides the waves of awards buzz.Rounding out the top five is The Greatest Showman. Hugh Jackman's musical brought in $11 million during its fifth weekend to raise its U.S. total to $113.4 million.Coming in sixth is Paddington 2 with $8.2 million. The acclaimed family film continues its struggles to make an impact at the box office, with a domestic haul of just $25 million. It's fared much better internationally, with a global total of $172.2 million.Liam Neeson's latest action vehicle, The Commuter, comes in seventh with $6.6 million. The film now stands at $25.7 million Stateside.Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the #8 film with $6.5 million. Though the sequel bombed its way out of China, it's done just fine in the U.S. with a total of $604.2 million. Lucasfilm's latest blockbuster is the sixth film in history to cross the $600 million plateau and will likely pass The Avengers for fifth all-time before it bows out of theaters.Coming in ninth is Insidious: The Last Key, which earned $5.9 million in its third weekend. The horror sequel is now up to $58.7 million domestically. That's more than enough to spin a nice profit out of its $10 million budget and it's the second highest-grossing installment of the franchise. With $126.8 million worldwide, Blumhouse could be inclined to continue it since interest is still there.Capping off the top 10 is Forever My Girl, which opened with $4.7 million.[NOTE: These are only weekend box office estimates -- based on Friday and Saturday ticket sales coupled with adjusted expectations for Sunday. Official weekend box office results will be released on Monday, January 22 -- at which time we'll update this post with any changes.]Source: Box Office Mojo

Welcome to the Screen Rant Box Office Prediction. Every week we put together an informal list of box office picks for the upcoming weekend to offer readers a rough estimate of how new releases (and returning holdovers) will perform in theaters.For a recap of last week's box office totals, read our box office wrap-up from last weekend, and scroll to the bottom of this post to see how our picks matched up.Full disclosure: Box office predictions are not an exact science. We acknowledge our picks may not always be correct. For the sake of offering a jumping off point for discussion, here are our picks for the weekend of January 19 - 21, 2017.This weekend, 12 Strong opens in 3,002 theaters, Den of Thieves plays in 2,432 locations, and Forever My Girl debuts in 1,115 theaters.We believe Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (read our review) will be able to pull off the three-peat this weekend. Once the hoopla surrounding Star Wars: The Last Jedi died down, the adventure film soared to the top of the charts and hasn't looked back since. With little in the way of meaningful competition opening this weekend, The Rock's latest vehicle should be able to continue its domination and win the weekend again. It's been holding very well for the last month.Our choice for second is 12 Strong (read our review), the new war drama starring Chris Hemsworth. The film is based on the true story of the Horse Soldiers, who were among the first American soldiers deployed in Afghanistan during the war on terror. It appears to be targeting the same demographic as Michael Bay's 13 Hours, which opened to the tune of $16.1 million back in 2016. That number seems like a reasonable ballpark for 12 Strong, which is projected to bow with around $12 million in its first three days. The famous names in its cast give it a boost in star power, though reviews have been mixed and it will have to contend with the NFL playoffs this weekend. It'll be interesting to see how it performs, but since January is relatively quiet, the film should be able to post respectable figures.Coming in third should be The Post (read our review), which finished in second last week with $19.3 million. The historical drama will be appealing for cinephiles looking to keep up on all of this year's awards contenders. It's done well on the daily charts throughout the week, at times challenging Jumnaji for the #1 position. The Post should be able to do well ahead of the Oscar nominations being announced, especially with the pedigree behind it.Our choice for fourth is The Commuter (read our review). Liam Neeson's latest action flick outperformed expectations in its debut, bringing in $13.7 million last week. Though the movie isn't a critical darling, it's still received decent marks as a fun, if silly, time at the movies and that certainly can get the job done this time of year. It should be able to stick around for at least another week.Rounding out the top five should be Den of Thieves, a new crime thriller featuring an ensemble fronted by Gerard Butler and 50 Cent. Unfortunately, the reviews for this one haven't been great, as the film struggled to live up to its high-minded aspirations (Michael Mann's Heat was a clear influence). With several other movies currently vying for the attention of audiences, Den of Thieves will have an uphill climb at the box office. Estimates call for an opening weekend of just $5.9 million.Our PicksJumanji: Welcome to the JungleThe PostPaddington 2Star Wars: The Last JediProud MaryActualsJumanji: Welcome to the JungleThe PostThe CommuterThe Greatest ShowmanInsidious: The Last KeyNext week: Maze Runner: The Death Cure, and more!Sources: Box Office Mojo (Release Schedule), Box Office (Opening Weekend Projections)

The latest film from veteran Hollywood producer Jerry Bruckheimer, 12 Strong marks the feature film debut for director Nicolai Fuglsig. It tells the true story of a declassified mission from the outset of America's war on terror, in which a small group of soldiers were among the first deployed to Afghanistan to fight back against the Taliban. Its primary aspiration is to raise awareness of this incredible moment in history by giving these brave men a moment in the spotlight for all to see. On that front, the film is moderately successful in its goals, but doesn't reinvent the wheel. 12 Strong works as a tribute to the real-life American heroes who lived it, but is an overall generic war film without much substance.12 Strong begins on September 11, 2001, as America mourns the horrific terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Despite filing for a cushy desk job so he could stay close to his family, Alpha 595 captain Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth) requests to be reinstated as his team's leader so he can go overseas to defend the United States. Colonel Max Bowers (Rob Riggle) agrees to send the group out, and Mitch is joined by comrades such as Chief Cal Spencer (Michael Shannon), Sergeant Sam Diller (Michael Peña), and Sergeant Ben Milo (Trevante Rhodes) to go to Afghanistan.There, Mitch and his team are tasked with rendezvousing with the Northern Alliance's General Abdul Rashid Dostum (Navid Negahban), with the two leaders joining forces to deal the Taliban a major blow. Their primary mission is to assume control of the Afghan city Mazar-i-Sharif, hoping to accomplish their objective before the weather makes conditions unbearable. Meanwhile, Nelson and Dostum's contrasting personalities threaten to derail the mission, forcing the two to try to overcome their differences for the greater good.The film is a mixed bag in regards to its execution. On the positive side of the spectrum, Fuglsig does a good job of portraying the camaraderie and sense of brotherhood that exists between military members, as the main cast have chemistry with each other that shines through on occasion. Whether the ensemble is joking with each other while on base or trying to survive together in the heat of combat, viewers get the sense that this is a cohesive team with years of experience. There is also ample time dedicated to showcasing the relationship between Nelson and Dostum, which serves as the film's primary subplot. Those two characters share a decent amount of screen time with a nice arc as they learn valuable lessons about each other. Their dynamic may not be the most emotionally-rewarding this genre has seen, but it works for 12 Strong and pays off.Unfortunately, Ted Tally and Peter Craig's script has various shortcomings that prevent 12 Strong from reaching its full potential. Several of the characters are shortchanged and ultimately come across as two-dimensional individuals whose only real purpose is to flesh out the team. There are attempts to give some of the soldiers more to do (see: Milo's evolving friendship with his child "shadow"), but most of these sadly ring hollow due to insufficient characterization. The pair also have a hard time avoiding classic war movie clichés (concerned families back home, on-the-nose thematic dialogue) that are designed to tug at the heartstrings and not much else. 12 Strong deserves credit for striving to reach the bar set by its predecessors, but it falls a little short.As one might expect, first-time director Fuglsig isn't seamless as the helmsman. Where he struggles most is with pacing, as the film arguably overstays its welcome with a runtime of 130 minutes. While the story itself is fascinating and character motivations clear, the lack of emotional investment in many of the individuals can make it drag at points. The action sequences Fuglsig stages are adequate - in that they firmly establish how overmatched the American soldiers are - but they do grow repetitive as the film marches on and none of them truly stand out as the battle audiences will remember long after the movie is over. Still, the director has a steady hand at crafting set pieces and will hopefully improve as his career progresses.In regards to the performances, Hemsworth makes for a solid lead as Mitch, portraying the soldier as a well-meaning hero eager to go head-first into danger. While this isn't the most challenging dramatic role the actor has played, his screen presence and likability are more than enough to have audiences root for him - especially when the going gets tough. Hemsworth is complemented by Negahaban as Dostum, playing an effective riff on the mentor/mentee relationship. Their interactions can be tense or insightful depending on the situation, and credit goes to Hemsworth and Negahban for pulling it off. Michael Shannon has the most substantial part of the supporting players, and he is able to ground Spencer with the gravitas viewers have come to expect from the actor. However, much like the others on Mitch's team, there isn't a whole lot for Shannon to do because of how his role is written.For January releases, 12 Strong is far from the worst of the bunch, but it isn't exactly great, either. Fuglsig's intentions are clearly in the right place, celebrating the incredible accomplishments of its subjects with good work from his cast. However, 12 Strong comes up short of being the rousing commemoration it wants to be and will have a familiar feel to anyone with passing knowledge of earlier films of its nature. The script favors a standard narrative instead of something that digs a little deeper, meaning viewers who aren't already interested in the material won't be missing much if they choose to skip it. But for those in the mood for a decently-made war film, 12 Strong could be worth checking out in theaters.Trailer12 Strong is now playing in U.S. theaters. It runs 130 minutes and is rated R for war violence and language throughout.Let us know what you thought of the film in the comments!

Navid Negahban has worked steadily in Hollywood for years. He has appeared on TV shows like 24, Homeland, and is currently playing a recurring role on ABC’s Mistresses. He made headlines when he selected to play The Sultan in Guy Richie’s adaptation of Disney’s Aladdin. Navid will also portray the role of the Shadow King on the TV show Legion. Now he is set to appear in the upcoming biographical war film 12 Strong, where he will be portraying General Abdul Rashid Dostum. 12 Strong was released on January 19, 2018.Screen Rant got a chance to chat with Navid Negahban on press day, where we discussed what it was like to recreate the story of 12 Strong, the portrayal of Middle Easterners in the film, and what we should expect from Guy Richie’s adaptation of Aladdin.SR: This film depicts key battles that still have lasting effects in the Middle East. What was it like recreating this and were you familiar with the story?Navid Negahban: I wasn’t familiar with the story at all and it was kind of fascinating for me to find out, Oh my God. These are the things that have happened and we didn’t know about it.SR: Right.Navid Negahban: Getting to know the individuals who were involved in creating this movement, it was unbelievable. I mean, I met with Mark. I met with Bob and Mark and [mumbled] and they were telling me the stories and we didn’t know anything about it and what they went through and the bond and how, for example, the Afghan soldiers, how they were there. The first mission was to protect the American soldiers. JR was telling me that, “If anything happens to any of these guys and the person was responsible, I’ll kill you and I’ll kill the whole family.”SR: Which they touched upon in the film with the boy.Navid Negahban: They brought it in. Yeah.SR: Which is interesting that you brought it up because, you know, usually when you see military films, it’s always about a sense of brotherhood, a sense of family, and it’s interesting because now they’ve bonded so well with the Afghan people, the Afghans, that they just took them in and it’s very interesting to see that relationship progress. And you made a great point at the press conference saying that it doesn’t matter necessarily, like we are the same essentially.Navid Negahban: That’s what it is and one of the things that we forget and that we don’t realize. See, I grew up in Mashhad, Iran. Mashhad is kind of one of the cities of Iran that’s very close to Afghanistan and during the movements and everything that was happening, we had lots of Afghans come over, leave their families, and go back to fight. One of the things that was happening was that my mom, for example, was a school teacher, so there was lots of Afghan kids and through that I was able to get to know them and their culture and who they are. They are a very proud people, very honorable to the core. This is what it is. That is what you need to do. That is the way that is supposed to be and they were so friendly and they were so warm, so hospitable. Even when I lived in Germany, it was an Afghan family who, because I was on my own, an Afghan family that took me over and I had to go there every weekend for them to feed them. This is the culture. This is the mentality. They are very hospitable.SR: You’re right! My best friend is Lebanese and you are completely right. It is the Middle Eastern hospitality and one thing that I do love about this film is that it depicts Middle Easterns in a positive matter, especially in this day and age.Navid Negahban: In a true matter. Not a positive matter.SR: Yes!Navid Negahban: The thing is, one of the things that is happening we have projects here that were okay. They were there and just to feed ourselves. You create a movie that scares you and everybody wants to go see what it is about, but 12 Strong is a film, in my opinion, that doesn’t take side, shows you what has happened, and lets you judge it for yourself and that’s what I love about the film. That was what was important to me.SR: It’s interesting you bring that about and, just taking it from a visual aspect because this is Nikolai’s first movie I believe, he comes from a photojournalist background. Is that any different than anything you’ve experienced before in the way he’d set up shots and portray the landscapes?Navid Negahban: No because the landscape is one of the characters.SR: Exactly! It’s like its own character.Navid Negah: Without that, what Nikolai did, how he was able to, seeing the characters, seeing the actors, seeing how they relate to each other is one side of the story, but where they are and how tough it is for them to move and the bond that is being created because of the toughness, because of how difficult the movement is, that shows how human beings they, they forget about all of their differences when they are forced to move in the same direction. It doesn’t matter where you are from. It doesn’t matter what color. It doesn’t matter what nationality, what religion. I think all of us want to see that our kids grow up in an environment where they aren’t afraid to take a plane, so let’s get there. Let’s all of us join forces and go there instead of pointing fingers and going, “No. It’s your fault! No, it’s your fault! No, you did it!” Who cares? Let us create a ground zero and pick it up from there and build from there.SR: I am actually really shocked by how much heart this movie has and, funny enough, even how much but not a lot, but it has a well placed sense of comedic timing, especially with your character when he calls the Taliban [mumbled]...it’s so funny. This was amazing. This guy has balls of steel.Navid Negahban: He was like that. JR was telling me that this guy was so unpredictable. He comes and he walks. They are shooting at him and he starts walking and he says, “Oh, the bullets are not going to hit me. Are you coming? Let’s go!” This is who the guy was and he’s very playful. He’s very funny. Sarcastic. He tells jokes all the time. In the middle of the chaos, all of a sudden he finds something and starts laughing and they were telling me that his laugh was such a heartfelt laugh. That’s just who he is. I don’t know. Sometimes...I don’t know. You can’t judge a book by its cover.SR: Not at all. Not at all. He still holds a lot of power in that region. He’s the vice president there. What went into the preparation and how did you want to depict a younger version of him? How accurate did you want to be with that depiction?Navid Negahban: I wanted to be as close as I can be and one of the things that helped was Doug’s book and the script was giving me a kind of path that I had to move on. And then the depth of it, as Brian mentioned, Brian Williams, his book The Last Warlord, it gave me a different side. His was a biographical book. It showed how he grew up, what he went through, what he was fighting for and that was very helpful. Then, again, Brian, Mark, JR; they were very helpful to give me their point of view for Dostum. How they saw Dostum. And then I had [indiscernible], who came from Afghanistan and came to visit, he was giving me his opinion. And all of these things came together and created an image for me and then I wanted to be as truthful as possible. I even, my gosh, he is a very big guy. He’s very big and I was just all of the fast food restaurants became my best friend.SR: [laughs] You were like, “Best job ever!”Navid Negahban: No. No. I hated myself because I couldn’t move after that, but it was good. It was good. It was a character that also the Afghan people, the local Afghan people, and how they look at him and how they see him and some of them were fighting side by side with him. They were so old and playing Dostum and everybody would call me General and everybody was there and everybody would come help the guy playing Dostum.SR: How is Guy Ritchie’s Aladdin going to be comparable to the classic Disney film and do you sing?Navid Negahban: [laughs] No. My name is Singbad the Sailor so this is my name. I’m not a singer. My kids, they laugh at me when I start singing. Guy’s point of view goes deeper. One of the things he wanted to do and he was very, very cautious about it and he was emphasizing on that he wants to be very respectful to the characters.SR: Of the original tale or the classic Disney tale?Navid Negahban: The characters that he’s portraying in Aladdin. He’s very, very cautious. He wants to show the depth of each of these characters and the film itself will be a film that no matter how old you are, you’re going to enjoy it.SR: I can’t wait.Navid Negahban: It’s a fantastic team. Beautiful, beautiful team. I mean, you will see the costumes. Gorgeous! Unbelievable!MORE: Chris Hemsworth Interview for 12 Strong

12 Years a Slave is based on the memoir of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man and professional violinist from New York who, in 1841, gratefully accepted an offer of employment from two men, claiming to be fellow artists and members of a traveling circus. The morning after a night of fine dining and wining with the pair, Solomon awoke to a nightmare - discovering that he had been deceived, drugged, kidnapped and sold into slavery.Unable to find any free person who might listen to his protests - or brave enough to risk their own safety by aiding him - Solomon experienced humiliation, physical brutality and even unexpected kindness, before he became the property of Mr. Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender), a slave owner who prided himself on his ability to break the spirit of any rebellious servant on his plantation. However, even when faced with such insurmountable horror, a soul as strong and dignified as Solomon's could not be shattered.Directed by Steve McQueen (Hunger, Shame) and scripted by John Ridley (Red Tails), 12 Years a Slave is a well-crafted film that uses the topic of slavery in the pre-Civil War U.S. as a means for ruminating on the human condition. However, it fails to make a clear-cut statement about the slavery issue or provide new insight on that dark chapter in American history. And thus, because the film doesn't blink an eye - when it comes to portraying the cruelty/violence committed against blacks in the Antebellum South - there are times when it feels like (put bluntly) the equivalent of "torture porn" made for arthouse moviegoers.In the past, McQueen has also used larger subjects (the IRA Hunger Strike, modern sex disorders) to explore how what a person does and/or what others do to a person's body affects their spirit. That question is again his true focus with 12 Years a Slave, but the decision to use Solomon Northup's tale as a way to further explore the issue proves less effective at best, highly questionable at worst. As a result, the scenes that depict the dehumanizing nature of slavery are genuinely disturbing to watch, yet the film as a whole fails to offer the kind of personal and informative character study that would've made all the suffering portrayed more meaningful (from a discussion standpoint).Rest assured, 12 Years a Slave is as gorgeously shot and visually-composed as McQueen's past films; his frequent cinematographer Sean Bobbitt photographs the 19th-century South as a sweltering hell - characterized by fiery sunsets, treacherous bogs and sparse cotton fields - populated by Solomon, other slaves and their oppressors. Meanwhile, the editing choices made by McQueen and his trusted editor, Joe Walker, favor subtly when it comes to spacing out shots and/or scenes that parallel one another (for thematic effect). Similarly, much of Hans Zimmer's score is quiet and gentle - save for an early sequence (where Solomon is transported South by ferry), when the score becomes as over-the-top ominous as would befit a horror movie.Indeed, 12 Years a Slave often unfolds as a historical horror show, as Solomon encounters many a monstrous Southerner who is all too eager to hurt, rape and/or murder any black person that crosses their path. Problem is, Ridley's screenplay paints the story of Solomon Northup in overly broad strokes and fails to bring much depth to either the heroes, victims or villains. The end result is a narrative that skips too quickly through instances that offer complex insight; and, on occasion, almost seems to relish the moments that show the different slaves getting beaten, raped, flayed and hung (hence the "torture porn" label).Ejiofor's performance as Solomon is graceful and sympathetic, yet is undercut because the character is too thinly-written. No doubt, everyone who goes to see the film will cheer for Solomon to escape and reunite with his family, but Ridley's script fails to dig beneath his surface - as a human being and artist - and reveal who he truly is, as a real person (not just a figure to be idolized). Similarly, Fassbender brings a steely gaze and unhinged gusto to the role of Mr. Epps, yet the antagonist - a malevolent scoundrel who loves to torture his slaves and lusts for his hardest-working servant, Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) - is not written as being much deeper than your average Disney movie villain.Several of the film's most promising scenes involve the reputable supporting cast - Paul Giamatti as a slave auctioneer, Benedict Cumberbatch as Solomon's first master, Paul Dano as an especially-punchable slave foreman and Garret Dillahunt as a heavy drinker forced to work alongside the slaves he once ruled over - but their flimsy characterizations and the script's lack of payoff make their screen time feel a bit like afterthoughts (not helpful additions to the central battle of wills between Ejiofor and Fassbender).Sarah Paulson as Fassbender's wife, Alfre Woodard as a well-cared-for slave mistress and Nyong'o as the abused Patsey are just never given the chance to fully explore how women in their positions might have behaved - and, more importantly, why they act the way they do - in spite of sincere performances from all three actresses (especially Nyong'o). Finally, many a recognizable face pops ups for a scene or cameo, including Scoot McNairy (Argo), Quvenzhané Wallis (Beasts of the Southern Wild), Michael Kenneth Williams (Boardwalk Empire) and Brad Pitt as a progressive-minded Canadian; with the exception of Pitt, though, these roles aren't really worthy of the talent behind them.12 Years a Slave avoids feeling like cheap exploitation, but Ridley's script reduces the evils of slavery to a concept that isn't challenging and lets viewers disconnect from the atrocities portrayed onscreen, without having to ask themselves the really hard questions (like "Could I have behaved like that, if I'd been alive back then?"). McQueen's storytelling approach is more accessible here than with his previous films, yet it's also too removed and is partly to blame for making the viewing experience a punishing, yet ultimately hollow one.In the end, it's best to approach 12 Years a Slave with the expectation that you are going to watch a well-made meditation about a man who endures a terrifying journey (right out of a Franz Kafka novel) - not a film that really adds so much to the ongoing conversation about slavery.For those who are still undecided, here is the trailer for 12 Years a Slave:_____12 Years a Slave is now playing in a limited theatrical release in the U.S., but will continue to expand nationwide over the forthcoming weeks. It is 134 minutes long and Rated R for violence/cruelty, some nudity and brief sexuality.

13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi takes us back to the year 2012, as the country of Libya finds itself in a tumultuous state of change following the death of "Colonel" Muammar Muhammad Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi (Libya's main leader/ruler for decades), one year earlier. This is the environment that CIA security contractor and military veteran Jack Silva (John Krasinski) find himself in upon arriving in the Libyan city of Benghazi. There Silva works alongside his fellow contractors - including his old friend Tyrone "Rone" Woods (James Badge Dale), in addition to Mark "Oz" Geist (Max Martini), Kris "Tanto" Paronto (Pablo Schreiber), John "Tig" Tiegen (Dominic Fumusa), and one Dave "Boon" Benton (David Denman) - to provide security at a CIA annex, where the Chief (David Constabile) sees the contractors as little more than a last resort should things go wrong, as far as security is concerned.While Silva and his fellow contractors express their concerns about the protective measures that are in place at the Libyan U.S. diplomatic compound - currently housing one Ambassador Chris Stevens (Matt Letscher) - the compound's security team offer assurances that the situation is being handled carefully. However, when terrorist militants attack the U.S. compound on the anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks, things quickly go from bad to worse - and when it becomes clear that the backup will be too late to help, it falls upon Silva and his fellow contractors to launch a desperate rescue mission... even as the militants prepare to attack the Benghazi CIA station next.Drawing from Mitchell Zuckoff's 2014 book "13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi", 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi offers jingoistic posturing aplenty, yet also skirts around the politics that surround the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks - instead, exploring a Black Hawk Down-style action/thriller narrative that is centered around a small team of ex-military contractors that were involved in the incident. The adapted 13 Hours script penned by Chuck Hogan - the co-creator of The Strain TV show and the author of The Town's source material, "Prince of Thieves" - even provides a tightly constructed three-act narrative skeleton for the movie to build upon, with nary a dangling plot thread or extraneous story tangent to be found.Problem is, 13 Hours also paints the tensions between the contractors and members of the CIA (in particular, the annex Chief) in broad strokes, while at the same time failing to provide enough onscreen development time for the eponymous "Secret Soldiers" to amount to much more than two-dimensional archetypes. Director Michael Bay then stretches the storyline out to encompass a nearly two and a half running time with a focus on generating thrills and suspense - something that makes the film's already heavy-handed storytelling approach come off all the more ham-fisted, in the process. The end result: 13 Hours resembles a feature film-length version of a season of the TV series Homeland (season 4 in particular), albeit with the CIA drama/thriller show's best elements (intriguing plot points and character development) having been reduced in order to make more room for additional spectacle and action.Credit where credit's due, few directors know how to stage explosion-happy set pieces and/or stylized, yet grounded, action sequences like Bay does, and 13 Hours is evidence of just that. The film in turn combines the aesthetic elements of Bay's past work (constant fast-paced editing and dynamic camera shot choices/movement) with solid cinematography by Dion Beebe (Edge of Tomorrow) in order to craft combat scenarios and chase sequences that succeed in making the audience feel as though they too are right in the line of fire. 13 Hours' approach to re-staging the Benghazi terrorist attack is visually bombastic and spectacle-driven to the point that it becomes ridiculous, in terms of how much explosive action and destruction is actually shown onscreen - and for sure, there are certain moments where Bay unimaginatively recycles his work on films past (in particular, one of the most famous shots from Pearl Harbor is re-used here). Nevertheless, no one Bay-style action as well as Bay himself.However, Bay is (again) his own worst enemy when it comes to ratcheting up the tension and suspense here. 13 Hours succeed in creating a vision of Benghazi that feels like the setting out of a Western (for better or worse) where danger lurks around ever corner - yet, because virtually every scene in the film is shot and played out with the same over the top style (regardless of the tone or mood it's going for), the technique becomes more tedious than effective after a while. Moreover, as was indicated before, 13 Hours starts off with an overall tight first act (story-wise and in terms of pacing), before the action then kicks in and carries on for longer than necessary. On the whole, 13 Hours would've been better served by additional editing to trim out the excessive spectacle.The 'Secret Soldiers' themselves aren't developed far beyond recognizable war film genre 'types' (the jokester, the family man who can't leave the war behind him, and so forth), but 13 Hours benefits from having a talented roster of character actor bringing its primary characters to life. The Office alum John Krasinski packed on extra muscle for his role in 13 Hours, though it's his own dramatic acting skills and screen charisma that serves him best here. Similarly, noteworthy characters actors James Badge Dale (Iron Man 3), Pablo Schreiber (Orange is the New Black), Dominic Fumusa (Nurse Jackie), Max Martini (Pacific Rim) and David Denman (Krasinski's onetime Office costar) do fine work - lending humanity to the other members of the contracted security team, as does Toby Stephens (Black Sails) in a small role as Global Response Staff officer Glen "Bub" Doherty.Unfortunately, David Constabile (Low Winter Sun, Suits) can only do so much to elevate the character of CIA Chief "Bob" above being a glorified (and sniveling) obstacle holding the 'Secret Soldiers' back from saving the day properly in 13 Hours; the same holds true for other members of the CIA in the film, as played by such folk as Alexia Barlier (The Missionaries) and Freddie Stroma (Pitch Perfect). While most of the native Libyans in the film - be they terrorists, allies to the 'Secret Soldiers', or just residents who get caught in the cross-fire - are depicted as one-note stereotypes, Peyman Moaadi (A Separation) does solid and sympathetic work in the role of Amahl, a Libyan aide who does his best to help, even once the bloodshed starts to unfold around him.13 Hours has elements of a lean and efficient action/thriller, but is bloated and overblown thanks to Michael Bay's directorial approach. The film will no doubt prompt debates about how it portrays the events of the 2012 Libyan terrorist attack and what its political message (or lack thereof) means, but that will have more to do with the people having the debate - rather than anything that the movie itself actually has to offer on the subject. Indeed, 13 Hours is more mature than most of Bay's recent work solely because the bar has been set so low; thus, while some filmgoers will enjoy 13 Hours and appreciate its grisly portrayal of militaristic combat, other hoping the the film's subject matter would elevate it above being mindless action movie entertainment are likely to wind up being disappointed.TRAILER13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is now playing in U.S. theaters.

Michael Bay has spent most of the previous ten years making Transformers movies, with the exception of his true story-based crime tale Pain & Gain. The filmmaker will return to the realm of real-life stories for his next directorial effort, title 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi; a film that examines the September 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. State Department Special Mission Compound and a nearby CIA station in Benghazi, Libya.13 Hours is based on accounts of the Anex Security Team as well as author Mitchell Zuckoff's book about the event, titled "13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened In Benghazi". Bay called the shots on the film, drawing from a script by author/screenwriter Chuck Hogan (co-creator of The Strain), and directing character actors John Krasinski (The Office), Pablo Schreiber (Orange is the New Black), Max Martini (Pacific Rim), and James Badge Dale (Iron Man 3), among others.The first 13 Hours trailer is now online (watch it above) and even this footage alone features several recognizable signatures of Bay's filmmaking style (dramatic shots of American iconography, explosions, lens flares), though here it's grounded in a real-world thriller involving an attack on a U.S. compound. Peter Berg's Lone Survivor is the recent addition to that genre that the 13 Hours trailer footage brings to mind, though Bay's movie appears to have a more sophisticated and shinier cinematic aesthetic. Meanwhile, its tone brings to mind the director's earlier work in the 1990s (see The Rock, and so on).For those unaware, here is the synopsis for Zuckoff's 13 Hours source material:13 Hours” presents, for the first time ever, the true account of the events of September 11, 2012, when terrorists attacked the US State Department Special Mission Compound and a nearby CIA station called the Annex in Benghazi, Libya. A team of six American security operators fought to repel the attackers and protect the Americans stationed there. Those men went beyond the call of duty, performing extraordinary acts of courage and heroism, to avert tragedy on a much larger scale. This is their personal account, never before told, of what happened during the thirteen hours of that now-infamous attack.The 2012 Libyan attack was quickly politicized, but for his film Bay appears focused on documenting the incident through a terse cinematic action/thriller, not its aftermath (much like Lone Survivor). 13 Hours is reported to have a leaner budget than most of Bay movies from the past ten to fifteen years, yet like Pain & Gain this new Bay project doesn't abandon the filmmaker's tendency to emphasize spectacle over more insightful storytelling or character development - judging by the initial 13 Hours footage, anyway.Bay, shortly before he began filming 13 Hours, expressed a desire to start "flexing new muscles" and to explore different subject matter as a director; here, that's what he's doing There ought to be a decent-sized audience that's interested and willing to take a chance on the movie and see how Bay handles the material (despite their concerns), if only to find out how 13 Hours compares to recent true story-based U.S. military films like Zero Dark Thirty, Lone Survivor, and American Sniper, among other titles.13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi opens in U.S. theaters on January 15th, 2016.Source: Paramount Pictures

Season 1 of Netflix’s 13 Reasons Why was about as self-contained a story as you can get. Based on the novel by Jay Asher, the series was initially intended to be a feature film, but soon took on a new form as one of the streaming giant’s overlong, sometimes ponderous, supposedly bingeable originals. Though it covered sensitive, important topics like bullying, self-harm, rape, and suicide — sometimes in not the most sensitive of ways —  the questions of why Hanna Baker (Katherine Langford) killed herself and chose to explain why on a series of cassette tapes, didn’t have enough story to adequately fill 13 hours of television. Nevertheless, it still told its story from beginning to end. That’s a problem for season 2 as the series struggles to justify the unnecessary continuation of what was a self-contained story. For there to be 13 episodes in the first season was, if not totally necessary, at least ambitious in its design. The narrative device of Hannah’s recordings, mixed with the investigation into them made by Clay Jensen (Dylan Minnette), along with a multitude of flashbacks featuring the show’s expansive ensemble cast, gave the series enough structure to partially mitigate the more ponderous parts of the season’s storyline. With Hannah now gone the focus shifts to the lawsuit filed by her parents against the school for failing to protect her, as well as a second thread involving Polaroids as evidence of just how rampant bullying and sexual assault really are at this school. The photos and the mystery surrounding them are little more than a lateral move for the series, a secondary device intended to further mimic the structure of season 1, that only affords 13 Reasons Why a chance to rehash a story that’s already been told. Though it makes a concerted effort to cover important issues, the series often does so in a facile manner; platitudes are delivered in place of more meaningful examinations of the subject matter. There’s a scene early on in the new season where the school’s baseball coach listlessly reads his players a memorandum about consent. It’s meant to be perfunctory, but it’s also unintentionally representative of how the show itself often makes due with a superficial investigation of its own content. Many of those potential examinations wind up being tabled for the purpose of pushing Clay down the path of uncovering a new mystery, one seemingly in connection to Hannah’s suicide, and in convincing the audience there’s more to her story than was seen in the previous season. In doing so, 13 Reasons Why inadvertently invalidates the intended emotional impact of what came before. The most glaring evidence of this is in how the series works Hannah back into the story. By becoming a hallucination, a manifestation of Clay’s guilt and lingering feelings for her, the series can utilize Langford outside of the occasional flashback, and also put her in scenes with Minnette to once again capitalize on their on-screen chemistry and solid performances. But in doing so, 13 Reasons Why ultimately undermines the poignancy it was chasing with Hannah’s story, and it makes the controversial choice to depict her suicide in graphic detail more difficult to justify to those claiming it glamorized the act. A hallucinatory Hannah aside, the second season’s biggest problems have more to do with its structure and inert story than anything else. Right away it becomes clear the season's narrative foundation is built on sand, which is worsened by a lack of forward momentum and over-reliance on rehashing the past, making it more ponderous than even the most inessential portions of the previous season. There’s a valid attempt to turn various student courtroom testimonies into the same narrative device that season 1 employed, but given that the most significant emotional beats have already played out in excruciating detail, the effort here lacks both the necessary emotional force and narrative drive to feel meaningful. In addition, the episodes are much too long. Season 1 was around six hours of actual story spread out over twice that amount, the issue is compounded here, and the result is that the dreaded streaming drift begins to set in around episode 4. 13 Reasons Why is certainly well-intentioned, something that’s made evident by its attempts to tackle difficult subject matter, as well as the appearance of plainly worded PSAs and links to crisis help lines and other valuable resources. Some of that stems from the wave of criticism and backlash the series received last year, which was retroactively corrected in much the same manner. Some of it is also clearly a product of the series' producers demonstrating an increased awareness of their show’s content and core audience. But as is sometimes the case, the intent of or message in a story warrants a more compelling delivery, one that feels not only urgent but also necessary. With its myriad flashbacks, hallucinations, and recycled narrative devices, 13 Reasons Why season 2 is unfortunately neither.Next: Sense8 Series Finale Trailer Promises One Last Mission13 Reasons Why season 2 is currently streaming on Netflix.

[WARNING: This piece contains spoilers for 13 Reasons Why]-Netflix recently rolled out 13 Reasons Why, a gripping yet gut-wrenching adaptation of Jay Asher's best-selling YA novel of the same name. It's told from the perspective of Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford), a high school teen who kills herself and leaves behind a collection of pre-recorded, confessional tapes to detail why. The story cuts between her poignant narration of the events that led up to her death and the aftermath unfolding in present day, centered around her crush-slash-resident nice guy Clay Jenkins (Dylan Minnette).Though only about a week out from its release, the show has already raked in widespread critical acclaim, particularly for its frank and powerful depictions of issues like bullying, sexual assault, and suicide. By the end, Hannah's story had finished, but the team behind the TV iteration did well to craft compelling narratives for its supporting characters, spurring speculation that more episodes could happen down the line.In an interview with EW, Asher said that he's among the people who want to see a season 2. As he told the outlet:“I’d just like a continuation of all those characters. I’m curious as well. What happens to Clay? How do people react to what Alex did at the very end? What’s going to happen to Mr. Porter? I’d thought of a sequel at some point. I’d brainstormed it, but decided I wasn’t going to write it. So I’d love to see it.”The author went on to say that he couldn't confirm or deny if a second season was indeed in the works, but did explain that the final episode wasn't crafted with more episodes in mind.“Things weren’t left open in the hopes of a sequel… There is no end for the characters left behind. Every action we have is going to have repercussions in ways we could not anticipate. You realize that with not just what Hannah did, but also how other people treated Tyler throughout it. It’s the whole message of the book. Of course, there’s obviously ways to go with a second season if they do that.”Though 13 Reasons Why's first season was largely self-contained, there are plenty of plot points to pick up with should it return for another season. So, while the title might not necessarily apply, there's more than enough story to work with, and it certainly seems like there's a demand for more. Netflix is rarely stingy with green-lighting its original series, so a season 2 is possible, but it will probably be some time before there's any official word.Next: 13 Reasons Why Is A Step Forward For TV’s Portrayal of Rape13 Reasons Why season 1 is available on Netflix.Source: EW

According to 13 Reasons Why star Katherine Langford, Hannah Baker will be very different when the show returns for season 2. The controversial teen drama first premiered last spring, tracing the months leading up to Hannah's suicide through a series of tapes she left behind. Despite some pushback for its candid depictions of topics like bullying, suicide, and sexual assault, it fast became a runaway hit, and though initially billed as a limited series, landed a renewal from Netflix in response.This raised a lot of questions about what, exactly, a second season would look like. The first was adapted from Jay Asher's YA novel of the same name, and by the finale, had covered the entirety of his book. Continuing the series, then, would mean drafting fresh material, as well as figuring out how Langford might fit in. Hannah's tapes had finished, and with the character dead, so had her story.Related: 13 Reasons Why Adds 7 New Cast Members for Season 2In an interview with Entertainment Weekly discussing her recent Golden Globe nomination, Langford addressed some of these factors, explaining that the narrative will broaden to include the other students at Liberty High. She told the outlet:“This season has been really interesting for a lot of reasons. It’s a different story than season 1 and I think that’s a good thing. This season we get to explore a lot more of the other characters and their journeys, which I’m excited about. As sad as it is, there is life after Hannah, and this season we get to see the effects it had on the people around her a lot more.”That also means fans might see Hannah in a different light. The first season was told entirely through her perspective, but in season 2, 13 Reasons Why has the freedom to explore things from new angles. Langford continued:“You see a very different Hannah in season 2. I would prepare fans not to expect the Hannah from season 1 for a multitude of reasons.” But is it the last we’ll see of Hannah? "It’s funny because I just wrapped [filming] and I think a lot of this season for me is about letting Hannah go.”This might reveal new details about Hannah's life viewers weren't privy to before, or could delve further into the aftermath of trauma. Hannah's peers were deeply affected by her death, and when the show left off, many of them were still grappling with their feelings. There are also a few major cliffhangers to explore, as well as the ongoing lawsuit launched to investigate the troubling details shared on Hannah's tapes. For a "limited series," there was a lot left hanging in the balance, and though Hannah will no longer be the central focus, it sounds like she'll still be a very present force in 13 Reasons Why, and perhaps even gain some closure to her story.MORE: Selena Gomez Weighs In On 13 Reasons Why Controversy13 Reasons Why season 1 is available for streaming now on Netflix; season 2 is scheduled to arrive in 2018.Source: EW

[This is a review of the 13 Reasons Why premiere. There will be SPOILERS.]–In recent years, Netflix has been building up its library of original content by introducing critically acclaimed programs like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, establishing their own corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with The Defenders shows, and continuing the legacies of previously cancelled series with Arrested Development, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, and Fuller House. Netflix's well of inspiration for their original content is expansive, and their latest offering is an adaptation of the best-selling, award-winning young adult novel, 13 Reasons Why.The premise of both Jay Asher's book and Netflix's original series is rather simple: Clay Jensen (Dylan Minnette) is an average, if socially awkward, high school student who one day receives a box of cassette tapes recorded by his classmate, Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford). The twist, however, is that Clay receives the box of tapes after Hannah has committed suicide and they detail the 13 reasons - namely, people - why she killed herself. It's both a drama and a mystery as Clay listens to the tapes in order to discover why exactly he's included in her story.Netflix's 13 Reasons Why begins with the series premiere, 'Tape 1, Side A', which establishes that each of season 1's 13 episodes will see Clay follow Hannah's story through the reasons why she committed suicide. 13 Reasons Why was adapted from Asher's book by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Brian Yorkey (Next to Normal), who serves as series creator and writer of 'Tape 1, Side A'. The series premiere was directed by Tom McCarthy (Spotlight) who additionally serves as executive producer on the show, along with pop star/actress Selena Gomez (Spring Breakers).The premiere episode opens roughly a week after Hannah dies, with Clay and the rest of the school dealing with her death in a variety of different ways; Clay seems to be the most haunted by her death and gets lost in memories of her. He's confronted at school by a disgruntled classmate about Hannah's death, though he doesn't understand why, and arrives home to a mysterious package with his name on it, thus beginning his journey through the final year of Hannah's life.As viewers would expect of a series tackling the topic of teen suicide, 'Tape 1, Side A' is a largely dour and dramatic affair, with only brief moments of humor to add a bit of levity - and often these take place within the flashbacks to Clay and Hannah's relationship at the beginning of the year. The stark contrast between Clay during the flashbacks and after Hannah's death is no doubt intentional, and helped along by the cinematography. While his memories of Hannah are tinged in bright, warm colors - yellow, red, orange - Clay's life after her death is painted in blues and greens, even down to his wardrobe.The visual cues - and, at times, the musical ones, particularly when Clay discovers the package of cassette tapes on his front porch - are somewhat heavy-handed but forgivable due to the nature of the story and, in particular, Hannah's blunt way of life. There is an honesty to Hannah, who isn't afraid to wear her heart on her sleeve, particularly in the early days of her story, that allows for the overly obvious cinematography and music - it's her story after all, even if Clay appears to be the character the audience is set to follow through all 13 episodes.Additionally, we'd be remiss not to discuss the obvious nostalgia included in the 13 Reasons Why series premiere. Cassette tapes were out of date even when Asher's novel first debuted a decade ago in 2007, and they're even more old school in Netflix's adapted series. Enough time of 'Tape 1, Side A' is dedicated to Hannah explaining why she used tapes that it's believable, even if slightly unrealistic. Clay, meanwhile, is forced to steal a portable tape player from his friend Tony (Christian Navarro), who is established early on in the episode as a fan of older technology like cassette tapes. Then, of course, there's the soundtrack of Joy Division playing over some of 'Tape 1, Side A', including the end credits song "Love Will Tear Us Apart" that helps to tie together the theme of nostalgia in 13 Reasons Why.Beyond the hook and mystery of Hannah's tapes as well as the series' obvious nostalgia influences, 13 Reasons Why excels due to the performances of its young cast, particularly Minnette and Langford, who play the equally complicated - though exceptionally different - Clay and Hannah to perfection. At times, the writing of Clay tries to force the character into the box of the socially awkward nerd, an old and tired archetype especially in teen dramas, but Minnette brings a charm to him that helps the character break out of that cliche. Similarly, Langford helps Hannah to flourish within the story, grounding her actions when the character could easily fall into the trapping of a manic pixie dream girl.Certainly, the relationship between Clay and Hannah, in the past though it is, is at the core of 13 Reasons Why especially since the arrival of the tapes causes Clay to question everything he had known about his former friend - or, rather, everything he thought he knew. Because, while Clay and Hannah help to ground the series, it is more broadly about extremely realistic issues facing teenagers, including bullying, slut-shaming, the at times cruel dynamics of high school, and, of course, suicide. 'Tape 1, Side A' only scratches the surface of these topics, and promises to explore them in depth through its subsequent 12 episodes, but it's a compelling entry point to a unique story with universal themes.All in all, 13 Reasons Why is an excellent blend of teen drama and mystery that may, in later episodes, be dragged down by its grim tone. The series premiere establishes a compelling question - why did Hannah commit suicide? - that will likely carry viewers through the twists and turns of the season, even those that read the book and know how it all ends. It remains to be seen whether 13 Reasons Why will be able to garner the popularity of other teen dramas like My So-Called Life or Skins, but it certainly sets out to be the next exceptional drama that just so happens to be geared toward teens - and, for the most part, it succeeds.Next: What to Look Out For on Netflix in 201713 Reasons Why season 1 is available in its entirety on Netflix.

[This is a review of the 13 Reasons Why season 1 finale. There will be SPOILERS.]–Netflix's latest original drama, 13 Reasons Why, comes to a compelling conclusion as Clay (Dylan Minnette) finishing listening to the tapes Hannah (Katherine Langford) recorded before she committed suicide, and decides what to do next. On the surface, 13 Reasons Why is a faithful adaptation of the best-selling YA novel from Jay Asher, Thirteen Reasons Why, following Clay Jensen as he listens to a series of cassette tapes recorded by his classmate/friend/girl for which he pined for a number of years as she tells the story of how her life unraveled and the "reasons" she committed suicide.However, even in the 13 Reasons Why series premiere, it became clear that this particular adaptation would include a great deal more of the story surrounding Clay, Hannah, their families, friends, as well as the students and school faculty members featured on the tapes. In fact, while Clay - and, by extension of the tapes, Hannah - is the main protagonist of 13 Reasons Why, the series puts focus on the likes of Hannah's parents, especially her mother Olivia (Kate Walsh), her classmates Jessica (Alisha Boe) and Justin (Brandon Flynn), and the person Hannah trusted to keep the second copy of the tapes, Tony (Christian Navarro).In the 13 Reasons Why season 1 finale, 'Tape 7, Side A' - written by showrunner Brian Yorkey and directed by Kyle Patrick Alvarez - many of these storylines come to a satisfying conclusion, as many would expect given the standalone nature of Asher's novel. Clay, as number 11 on the tapes and having decided to skip number 12 - Bryce (Justin Prentice), the classmate responsible for raping Jessica and Hannah - passes the box of tapes along to the school's guidance counselor Mr. Porter (Derek Luke) after confronting him about his role in Hannah's suicide.The scene between Clay and Mr. Porter is spliced with the scene in which Hannah tried to ask the counselor for help, hinting at her suicidal thoughts and how she was raped by a classmate. Just as in the series premiere - and throughout the season - the different tones of the cinematography are a stark contrast, with Hannah's being washed in bright, warm light, while Clay's is full of cooler colors. The scene marks an emotionally climactic point in the stories of Clay and Hannah, and is beautifully written to highlight the different goals of each confrontation, keeping the tension high as Clay and Hannah try to get what they came for even as the viewer knows Hannah did not. Both Minnette and Langford demonstrate fantastic performances of their respective characters in the scene, bringing it all together.This particular sequence of Clay's confrontation also follows Hannah through the aftermath of her own discussion with Mr. Porter, which includes her distributing the two sets of cassette tapes and returning home to commit suicide. Netflix precedes this episode with a trigger warning about disturbing images and there's no doubt it was referring to the scene in which Hannah slits her wrists in her bathtub and waits to die. The sequence is unblinking in its portrayal of Hannah killing herself, with the camera not allowing viewers to look away from the moment, then focusing on Hannah's face as she sits and waits.It's a brutally honest sequence, reminiscent of all the other honest moments in 13 Reasons Why as Hannah unflinchingly told her story. The scene is directly followed by Olivia walking into the bathroom some time later to discover Hannah, and the reactions of both Olivia and her husband Andy (Brian d'Arcy James) prove the show's dedication to depicting both sides to every story told throughout the course of season 1. While 13 Reasons Why is ostensibly Hannah's story of why she committed suicide, it's as much the story of how everyone in her life was impacted by her death, which is what makes the series so successfully compelling.Aside from the emotionally moving scenes of Clay and Hannah's emotional turning points, 'Tape 7, Side A' also spends a great deal of time wrapping up various other story threads. Jessica breaks up with Justin, who has left his mother's house for good and is emotionally unraveling from the fallout of his actions; Jessica also makes a decision of how to proceed after learning the truth of what happened at her party, starting off by telling Clay not to turn over Hannah's tapes, then beginning to tell her father.Tony, who has struggled throughout season 1 with how to handle the task Hannah left him with, gives Hannah's parents digital copies of her tapes. Mr. Porter is shown finishing listening to Hannah's tapes when the school principal rushes in to tell him Alex Standall (Miles Heizer) - a student included on Hannah's tapes - has shot himself and is in critical condition. Elsewhere, Clay reaches out to his fellow classmate and former friend Skye (Sosie Bacon) and they leave school together with Tony and Tony's boyfriend Brad (Henry Zaga).These final scenes seem to hint 13 Reasons Why sets the stage for a second season, but also work as an open-ended conclusion to the series if the show's creators and Netflix decide not to continue on. It's a satisfactory conclusion as is, portraying the far-reaching effects of not only Hannah's suicide but the events leading up to her death as well. Whether or not Netflix grants the show a second season, 13 Reasons Why set out to tell a difficult story in the most honest way possible, and in that much, it greatly succeeds.Next: 13 Reasons Why Is A Step Forward For TV’s Portrayal of Rape13 Reasons Why season 1 is available in its entirety on Netflix.

13 Reasons Why has added seven new actors to its season 2 cast. The show, which debuted on Netflix last spring, was renewed in May after a wave of controversy. Its unflinching depiction of issues like bullying, suicide, and sexual assault was to some revolutionary, and to others both troubling and deeply problematic. The first season, based on Jay Asher's 2007 novel of the same name, focused on Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford), a high school teen who takes her own life and leaves behind a series of tapes detailing each of the people and reasons she deems responsible.By the finale episode, Baker's story (at least from her perspective) had finished, seemingly positioning the drama as a limited series. That, combined with the rampant backlash that followed, led many viewers to believe it may not get a second shot on screen. But its overwhelming popularity ultimately won out, and writers found a way to continue the narrative from different points of view.Now, Variety reports 13 Reasons Why has added a number of new faces to the fold, including Anne Winters (Tyrant, The Fosters), Chelsea Alden (American Horror Story), Allison Miller (Incorporated), Samantha Logan (Melissa & Joey), Kelli O’Hara (Masters Of Sex), Ben Lawson (Doubt), and Bryce Cass (2016's Cruel Intentions). None of the actors will be series regulars, but many will appear in a majority of the episodes throughout the season.O’Hara, a Broadway vet and Tony winner, will play Jackie, a “warm, intelligent” anti-bullying advocate; Logan, who portrayed Tia Stevens on The Fosters, has been cast as Nina, a “well-respected track star with a secret"; Lawson will play Liberty High’s beloved baseball coach, Rick; and Miller will take on Sonya, a “smart and ambitious young litigator.” Other students include head cheerleader and resident "it girl" Chloe (Winters), “cynical mischief maker” Cyrus (Cass), and Cyrus’ artistic sister Mackenzie (Alden).13 Reasons Why season 2 is expected to revolve around the lawsuit filed by Hannah's parents against the high school after finding they may have played a complicit part in her death, and that her counselor may have overlooked (or at worst, outright ignored) her admission of suicidal thoughts. It's not yet clear what role, if any, these new characters will play in that, but it reaffirms the show's intent to explore other sides of Hannah's story, including pivoting to a new narrator. Whether or not that will be enough to assuage previous criticisms remains to be seen, but all eyes will certainly be on 13 Reasons Why when it returns.Next: 13 Reasons Why Showrunner Offers Season 2 Story Hints13 Reasons Why season 1 is available for streaming now on Netflix; season 2 is scheduled to arrive in 2018.Source: Variety

The cast of Netflix original series 13 Reasons Why is being fleshed out for the show’s second season, with four new names now attached to appear in the next slate of episodes. 13 Reasons Why season 1 became a hit earlier this year, adapting the young adult novel of the same name by Jay Asher and tackling usually-taboo topics of bullying, suicide and rape in graphic detail. Though controversy has swirled around how some of the scenes were presented to viewers, the show was renewed back in May.Focusing on the story of Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford), season 1 delivered the details of how the young teen would take her own life after being forced to deal with bullying throughout her high school life. Before killing herself however, Hannah would record a series of cassette tapes and leave them behind for those she deemed responsible for her decision, demanding that they each listen to her ’13 reasons’. Though the entirety of Asher’s novel was told in the first season, the roster of characters that viewers got to know throughout those episodes will be making a return in season 2.Related: Selena Gomez Responds to 13 Reasons Why ControversyThanks to the details provided about four new characters (via Deadline) joining the show in 13 Reasons Why season 2, we now have a better idea of whose stories we may be delving deeper into this season. Jake Weber (Medium) and Brenda Strong (Supergirl) have signed on to play Barry and Nora Walker; parents to rapist Bryce (Justin Prentice) and well-respected members of the community. Criminal Minds alum Meredith Monroe will play Alex’s mother Carolyn, while R.J. Brown (The Carrie Diaries) is stepping into the role of Tony’s boxing trainer Caleb. They join the previously-announced 7 new additions to season 2.Bringing Bryce’s parents onboard means that we should be seeing the character face some consequences for his criminal actions in season 1. He was a guy who felt no remorse about raping girls, but when the first season wrapped, we hadn’t yet seen any justice dealt out. Whether or not his parents will stand by their son however remains to be seen; being described as “pillars of the community” however, we wouldn’t be surprised if they tried to brush the entire ordeal under the carpet. Alex’s mother will of course be dealing with her son’s own attempted suicide, while Caleb should be providing some comic relief, with the character described as having “a warm smile and a wry sense of humor”.Bringing some new faces on board will certainly reinvigorate the show - and with the plot now being completely original and away from anything Asher wrote in the novel, they could provide some stellar moments that will be new to both long-time fans and those who have recently joined the ranks. There are plenty of predicted paths that 13 Reasons Why season 2 could go down, but now these additions could bring something entirely different to viewers.Then again, with so many stories still ongoing from the first season, it would be a shame for the series to get bogged down with inconsequential sub-plots and filler content. Hopefully, the new cast additions will help rather than hinder tell the next part of the 13 Reasons Why story.NEXT: How 13 Reasons Why Created An Authentic Teen Experience13 Reasons Why season 2 is expected premiere on Netflix in 2018.Source: Deadline

13 Reasons Why star Christian Navarro is hoping the series returns for a second season. Netflix's latest hit has already become the most tweeted about TV show of 2017, just a month after its release. Based on Jay Asher's YA book of the same name, 13 Reasons Why retrospectively follows Hannah Baker through her final few days before she decides to take her own life. Thanks to the 13 cassette tapes she leaves behind, we are introduced to the characters in her life that influenced her, and, ultimately, her decision.One character that features heavily in the show, is Tony, played by Christian Navarro. Tony is responsible for delivering Hannah's tapes to the intended recipients, and he also provides friendship and mentorship to Clay (Dylan Minnette). The character almost exists entirely separately to the rest of Hannah's peers; he is quieter, more introspective, and infinitely more mature. He almost seems to come from a different time and place.With the popularity of 13 Reasons Why, comes the now near certainty of a second season pickup. Whether a second season is needed seems almost irrelevant; it will happen owing to the show's huge popularity and ever-growing fanbase. What form that second season could take remains to be seen; with so many unanswered questions at the end of season one, there are plenty of storylines to explore.One such possible thread is the relationship between Tony and Hannah; she trusted him enough to have him get her a tape recorder, and to deliver the tapes after her death, but we never know exactly how close they were. Speaking to EW, Navarro says there's definitely more story to be told:"We have secrets, none that I choose to reveal right now, but hopefully we get to explore it in a second season. I think there’s a lot more to the story.”Those secrets are pertaining to the backstories that both Navarro and Katherine Langford have given their characters, since Tony is a minor character in the book, and Asher hasn't written a sequel, so any second season of 13 Reasons Why will be entirely original. The show could also explore the aftermath of the tapes; what motivated Alex to try and take his own life; what Tyler intends to do with a bag full of guns and ammo; whether Bryce will be arrested for rape; and, for Navarro, whether his character will shoulder some of the blame for Hannah's death, even though he was never the subject of one of her tapes:“I think that he’s culpable in a lot of ways for holding onto these tapes, so he’s got to pay some sort of consequence in that regard.”Unless a second season chooses to go back in time, there will need to be a new protagonist, and, if keeping the same format, a new narrator. Could we see Tony's own account, maybe titled 14 Reasons Why?NEXT: 13 Reasons Why Author Wants Season 213 Reasons Why is available for streaming on NetflixSource: EW

13 Reasons Why has started filming its second season, ready for a 2018 release. Though no exact release date has been confirmed, with filming underway, and a 6-8 month shoot expected, it seems logical to assume we can expect season 2 of the controversial drama to arrive around a year after season one first aired. Following Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford), a high school student who decided to take her own life, 13 Reasons Why tackled sensitive issues of bullying, rape, and suicide, head on, and made no apologies for doing so.With an ensemble cast, including Dylan Minnette, Alisha Boe, Christian Navarro, and Justin Prentice, 13 Reasons Why became a huge hit despite its controversy, and made instant stars of its cast. A second season of 13 Reasons Why is something many questioned there being any need for - though given the show's popularity, its renewal was almost inevitable.Navarro, who plays Tony in the show, confirmed that filming had started on 13 Reasons Why season 2, via his Twitter account:Day One. S2. Ready to make some magic. — Christian Navarro (@ChristianLN0821) June 12, 2017 13 Reasons Why season 1 was based on the YA novel of the same name by Jay Asher, but there is no second book on which to base the second season on. As such, it's down to showrunner Brian Yorkey to come up with a compelling enough storyline that fans will take on board and respond to as well as they did with the first season.Despite season 1 following Hannah, and showing her suicide in graphic detail, Langford will return in season 2. There will be a different narrator this time around (place your bets), and the show will look at Hannah's story as seen by other characters, giving further insight into what her peers, parents, and teachers thought of her. The show will once again jump between past and present, with the ongoing court case between Hannah's parents and the school still playing a part. Also in the present are a number of unresolved cliffhangers from the seaon one finale, that will hopefully be addressed. Alex seems to have shot himself, and whether he lives or dies should (we assume) become apparent pretty early on in season 2. Fans are also waiting to see if Tyler is going to try and carry out the school shooting that he seemed to be gearing up for, or whether that crisis can be averted.The overwhelming issue that fans want to see tackled, though, is for Bryce to face justice for his rape of Hannah and Jessica. At the end of season 1, Jessica had found the courage to tell her father what had happened, while Clay had taped Bryce's confession and handed it over to the school guidance counselor. While that tape/ forced confession might not be admissible in court, it must surely have ramifications for him in some way, and Jessica needs to be given help to deal with events. With 13 Reasons Why now filming, we might well get a clue to some of the storylines over the next few months, but we'll get our answers for sure, when season 2 arrives on Netflix.NEXT: Selena Gomez Responds to 13 Reasons Why Controversy13 Reasons Why season 1 is available for streaming now on Netflix.Source: Christian Navarro

Warning: Spoilers for 13 Reasons Why Season 2At the heart of 13 Reasons Why Season 2 is a court case meant to decide who was responsible for Hannah Baker's suicide. Ultimately, Hannah was responsible for her own death, but there were a multitude of events leading up to it which could, or should be to blame. A lot other events depicted across the entirety of 13 Reasons Why also came about thanks to many failings.For one school, Liberty High certainly has a lot of tragedies happen. Not only did Hannah Baker commit suicide, but Bryce raped Jessica and Hannah, Justin was neglected by his mom, Alex attempted suicide and Tyler was brutally beaten and sexually assaulted, before attempting to carry out a school shooting. There are certainly issues within the walls of Liberty High but are they, as Hannah's parents claim, responsible for Hannah's death due to their neglect?At the end of 13 Reasons Why Season 2, the school are found not guilty after a long and intense court battle, where the defense tried to discredit Hannah and her friends, as the prosecution attempted to highlight the failings of the school. Undoubtedly, the school let Hannah and many others down, but are they really responsible for her choice to end her life?This Page: Who's Really To Blame For Hannah Baker's Suicide?Page 2: What Liberty High Did WrongHannah Baker Did Know HappinessHannah's decision was made after many twists and turns that, frankly, are part of growing up for a lot of teenagers. Thanks to 13 Reasons Why Season 2, we now know she was happy in the summer of her sophomore year when she was in a relationship with Zach. She also had a crush on Clay, and always liked being around him. She had disagreements with friends - namely Alex, Jessica and Courtney - that weren't great, yet wouldn't have triggered most teenagers to be contemplating suicide.She was though, as Tony says, "a drama." Hannah was a victim, sure, but she was in no way blameless for the disagreements between friends. Zach made some stupid mistakes, and Marcus was a jerk to her, but again, they didn't do enough to be culpable.One Event Was The Final TriggerBryce Walker played a large part in Hannah's decision to take her own life. When he raped her in the hot tub, he not only violated her physically, but he destroyed her mentally and emotionally too. For an already unstable and vulnerable teenager, it all proved too much. Hannah sought out the school guidance counselor, Mr. Porter, to ask for help, but when she refused to name her rapist he told her there was nothing he could do.Should he have listened better? Of course. Hannah was clearly not in a good place and desperately needed help and a guidance counselor, of all people, should have recognized that. If we're pointing the finger at those who never listened or noticed Hannah's anguish, though, then we also need to look at Olivia and Andy Baker.Hannah's Parents Are Not Blame FreeHannah's parents seemed loving, attentive, and everything you'd expect from parents of a teenager; a little overprotective at times but overall they were doing good. Except... their daughter was driven to suicide and they didn't pick up on her becoming more withdrawn or upset. They didn't push for answers just like Mr. Porter didn't, just like Clay didn't, just like Tony didn't. Liberty High is guilty of neglect, but then, by the same token, so is everyone else. Hannah Baker had mental health issues that someone, somewhere should have picked up on. That way, she could have healed.Take a look at Jessica; for a while, it looked like she would be the next tragedy. Drinking heavily and in total denial, Jessica was headed down a dangerous path until Clay and Justin forced her to face up to what had happened. Her dad was that all-important listening ear, and in 13 Reasons Why Season 2, we see that Jessica is sleeping in her parents room, and that her dad sits with her every night until she falls asleep. Jessica is also attending a help group and gradually realizes that she doesn't need to let her rape define her anymore. All of that only came about because Clay and Justin were so hyper-aware of what happened to Hannah that they refused to let it happen again. Her parents, too, made sure to accompany her to the school in order to make sure she was safe in their care.Page 2 of 2: What Liberty High Did Wrong

13 Reasons Why season 2 will arrive on Netflix soon, and first look photos hint at rising tensions and trouble for Tony. 13 Reasons Why arrived on Netflix last year amid a whirlwind of controversy. Following Hannah Baker's decision to commit suicide, the show also dealt with many other issues such as bullying, rape, and substance abuse. The show suffered a backlash from concerned parents and others who felt the show glorified these issues, but 13 Reasons Why proved itself to be a huge hit, despite the heavy subject matter.Fans had been eagerly awaiting the arrival of season 2, which has now been given the release date of May 18th, and Netflix also released a short teaser. 13 Reasons Why's first season relied on old cassette tapes to tell its narrative, and now it seems as though photos will be used to continue the story in season 2. The teaser showed many characters outwardly having fun and behaving as normal, while Polaroids swirling about the screen told a very different story indeed.Now, EW has released first look images from 13 Reasons Why season 2 that confirm the show won't shy away from tackling difficult subjects again. See the photos below.Most notably, two of the images focus on the court case that Hannah's parents have brought against the school. In one, Olivia Baker (Kate Walsh) stands on the steps of the courthouse surrounded by press, while another shows Jessica (Alisha Boe) testifying in court, holding two photos as examples of the abuse she suffered from peers. There's also an image of Clay (Dylan Minnette) talking with Hannah (Katherine Langford) - who we're told will appear in flashbacks.At the end of season 1, Bryce confessed to raping Jessica and Hannah, and though the teaser trailer showed he was still a violent threat to women, it looks like his actions are beginning to have consequences; in the image released today, Mr. Porter is pinning him to a wall. Having listened to Hannah's tapes, he knows all about Bryce's behavior.Finally, we see fan-favorite Tony crying in the arms of a new character, Caleb (RJ Brown), following damage to his prized classic car. The teaser also hinted at some troublesome times for Tony ahead; repercussions for him distributing Hannah's tapes, maybe, or homophobic abuse? While we're still not totally clear on what course 13 Reasons Why will take in its second season, it certainly looks to be just as hard-hitting and emotional as season 1.Next: 13 Reasons Why Season 2: Every Update You Need To Know13 Reasons Why season 1 is available to stream on Netflix now.

13 Reasons Why Season 2 is changing up its plot device: instead of tapes from beyond the grave, this next run of episodes will be centered on polaroids. The new storyline for Netflix's controversial teen series is said to focus on accountability, with the show this time honing in on serial sexual assault. All this adds up to Bryce Walker having to pay for his crimes - and the new retro technology could be the thing that brings him and the other guilty students of Liberty High down.Hannah Baker certainly attempted to get people talking about the shady goings-on at her school, but in the end, it wasn't enough: while her cassette tape confessional turned some students against each other and has seemingly set her mother on a mission to uncover the truth, Hannah's accusations basically boil down to he/she said. Many of her former friends and classmates accused her of lying, and in the case of Zach Dempsey, we learned definitively that Hannah's version of the truth was not Zach's truth; he had actually kept the note she thought he had callously thrown away on his person. These misunderstandings may have aided in covering up many of the characters' questionable actions, but that may all change in season 2.13 Reasons Why season 2 will center on a series of polaroids that will lead the students of Liberty High to unravel a terrible mystery. This changeup is necessary narrative-wise and opens up some new storytelling aspects. As previously stated, Hannah's tapes could be easily refuted and written off as hearsay or gossip. While some of the recipients of the tapes took it upon themselves to explore the viability behind Hannah's accusations, little evidence has actually been uncovered at this point in the story. Even Clay Jensen's recording of Bryce's confession is weak; he never actually straight out admitted to anything and could have been talking about a simple flirtation when taken out of context.With a photo in hand, these teenagers' misdeeds will be a lot more difficult to deny. Pictures of Bryce assaulting a passed out partygoer are almost certain to lead to a conviction, with or without a confession. We've already seen that Tyler Down isn't above stalking his friends and his clandestine photo of Hannah and Courtney Crimsen led to ridicule and gossip about the girls' sexual orientation. The ladies may have hoped they weren't recognizable in the picture, but their classmates easily put the pieces together. Obviously, when the stakes are higher, the results will be more traumatizing and life-changing for a pictured student.There is one loophole that the kids of Liberty High may be able to exploit: even photos can be deceiving. Take, for example, Hannah's unfortunate upskirt photo on a playground slide; what began as an innocent night out with a potential boyfriend quickly spiraled out of control when Justin Foley showed his buddies a badly time photo of Hannah lying on the slide with her skirt pushed up. Anyone who knows the truth of that incident, or maybe just a really savvy perpetrator, may be able to talk away their crimes and convince those around them that the photos are just a case of being at the wrong place at the right time.But given the season's focus on redemption, this seems very unlikely. For 13 Reasons Why season 2, a picture could be worth 1,000 of Hannah Baker's tape-recorded words.Next: Who Is 13 Reasons Why Season 2’s New Narrator?13 Reasons Why season 2 will be available to stream on Netflix May 18.

13 Reasons Why season 1 adapted Jay Asher's book of the same name, depicting the events that lead up to the suicide of Hannah Baker. Upon her death, Hannah left behind 13 retro cassette tapes, each listing 'reasons why' she took her own life. More specifically, these 'reasons' were actually people whose actions had contributed to her decision. 13 Reasons Why was a huge hit, despite much controversy surrounding the show and criticism from parenting groups who said it glorified suicide.If anything, 13 Reasons Why actually delivered a stronger anti-suicide message than its source material; mainly because they made many alterations from the book, including having Hannah slit her wrists rather than take an overdose. This was a deliberate decision from showrunner Brian Yorkey, who wanted to show that suicide was not an easy choice. Throughout the course of season one, Hannah appeared both as the narrator of the tapes and also in flashback as the viewers traveled through the last few months of her life. Hannah's story was a tragic tale, and equally as heartbreaking was the effect it had on her parents, who ultimately decided to sue the school for negligence. As season one drew to a close, Hannah's peers who had been the subjects of the tapes, were subpoenaed to testify in the case.Related: What To Expect From 13 Reasons Why Season 313 Reasons Why ran out of source material at the end of season one, but Netflix quickly renewed it for season 2 due to its strong reception. The questions everyone had were 'why' and 'how?' Why was a show, which was perfectly contained in one outstanding season, renewed for another when it had served its purpose and could stand alone? How would the show return, now that we'd heard the tale of its main protagonist?This Page: The Court Case and Hanna's GhostPage 2: What it Should Have Been AboutThe Court Case Was The Link Between Seasons One And TwoThe court case that the Baker's brought against the school turned out to be the event that leads us into season two, but it wasn't ever going to be enough to sustain our interest. We learn that Olivia and Andy Baker have split up and that he's moved in with another woman. Olivia is far from over Hannah's death - not that you ever really would be - but because of the court case she's finding it even harder to move on with life. We hear from each of the tapes subjects in turn, and, frustratingly, the bulk of almost all the episodes in season 2 revolve around the person in the dock telling Hannah's story from their own perspective.The problem is, we already know it. There are a few revelations, such as Hannah and Zach's summer fling, and her recreational drug use with Clay, but there is nothing in this retelling that we needed to know as a viewer. If anything, it makes Hannah's fate have less of an impact since we learn she had major flaws; it's like her story is being watered down and we begin to care less. The court case drags; season two had no reason at all to be 13 episodes long and as a consequence, there's a lot of slow moments. At the end of season 2, Olivia Baker looks set to move to New York. It would have been far better if this had happened at the end of season one; we could have picked up season 2 with the court case having already taken place, and 13 Reasons Why could have moved on.Having Hannah Baker As A Ghost Was Ridiculous13 Reasons Why has given us many outstanding performances, and Katherine Langford was certainly one. During season 1, she played Hannah with a sweet but troubled vulnerability which made us feel so desperately sad about her fate, and her scenes with Clay (Dylan Minnette) were wonderful. It's easy enough to see why Yorkey didn't want to dispense with one of his most popular pairings, especially when you consider 13 Reasons Why's fervent teenage fanbase, and in particular Clay and Hannah's fans.All good things must come to an end, though, and there was no need at all to bring Hannah back as a ghost who not only lingers ominously in nearly all of  Clay's scenes, but now walks, talks, and interacts with him too. Ultimately, all this does is reduce 13 Reasons Why from an intense, uncomfortable but realistic portrayal of teenagers lives, to nothing more than a melodrama. Minnette is a strong enough actor; he didn't need Hannah's ghost to talk to for us to know he was working through some major issues. We wouldn't have expected him to be over Hannah's death, but this could have been showcased in so many other ways, not least by his conversations with his parents, teachers, and peers. Hannah's return made a mockery of the seriousness of the show, and it's no wonder critics were so mixed in their reviews. Not only was the continuing court case unnecessary, so was Hannah's presence, especially when there was so many other storylines building that were far more compelling.
