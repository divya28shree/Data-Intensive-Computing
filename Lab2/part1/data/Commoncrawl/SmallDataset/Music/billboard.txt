December 04, 2014 3:57 PM ESTSenior vp global entertainment, CitiBreithaupt is trying to remember what happened in January. "It feels like five years ago," she says in a nod to the breakneck pace of Citi's tireless and competitive work as a brand partner under her leadership. From hosting private cardmember events during Grammy Week in Los Angeles and Super Bowl Week in New York, to supporting Billy Joel's record-breaking monthly residency at Madison Square Garden, to sponsoring Live Nation and Yahoo's landmark Live 365 concert platform, to setting up a custom cardmember lounge for Katy Perry's Prismatic Tour, Breithaupt's Citi Private Pass program has been building experiences that go way beyond a ticket sale."Jennifer does the best job of any brand marketer whom we work with at building strong industry relationships [with artists, managers and promoters]," says Darin Wolf, Live Nation executive vp media and sponsorships. "She figures out how Citi can add value to the equation. And her ability to make quick, smart decisions helps Citi win more tours than any other company." Breithaupt persuaded Citi to increase its entertainment spend by 16 percent in 2014, with One Direction's tour alone generating a record $40 million in revenue from 458,000 cardmember tickets sold, up from $32 million and 370,000 in 2013. Up next: Continuing Private Pass' expanding involvement with global tours.

December 04, 2014 8:53 PM ESTExecutive vp business affairs/general counsel, Sony Music EntertainmentAll roads at Sony Music Entertainment go through Swidler, whose hands touch every deal made at the music industry's second-largest label group. That's major power -- SME will generate approximately $3 billion in 2014 revenue. In U.S. recorded-music sales, Sony's market share through Nov. 23 was 27.9 percent, a slight decrease from 2013.The majority of the dip comes from the defection of Glassnote earlier this year from Sony's RED distribution service to Universal, but Swidler has seen the positive impact of a deal she helped structure in 2013 to acquire dance label Ultra, home to Calvin Harris, Deadmau5 and Steve Aoki. Harris sold a very healthy 4.1 million tracks this year, according to Nielsen SoundScan, but just as important was bringing Ultra founder Patrick Moxey into the label's system by making him the president of electronic music at Sony."That was not a throwaway title for him," says Swidler. "He took it very seriously, and has weekly calls with our people worldwide where they talk about EDM and what's going on in music and who are the best A&R people out there."Swidler, who is married with three children and lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side, began her career in the legal department of the ad agency J. Walter Thompson, involved with the in-house publishing company for jingles. She has an office at 550 Madison Ave. next door to Epic chairman/CEO Antonio "L.A." Reid, known for playing his music loud. "I love hearing every mix of every new song he is working on," she says. But Swidler spent much of 2014 outside the office, traveling to London, Nashville and Los Angeles to meet with managers and artist reps. One consistent concern from the artist side: the payout of streaming services in the United States."I point out to them that those services are bigger in places like Scandinavia and France, where you have artists earning a fair amount of money in the streaming business," says Swidler. "I don't want people to feel that we are at the top of the mountain and won't answer questions. If people aren't getting answers, then I joke to them that they didn't ask me."

December 04, 2014 9:19 PM ESTIncoming Chairman/CEO, Universal Music Publishing GroupGerson is about to cata­pult from being one of the most powerful executives in the A&R sector to one of the most powerful executives in the overall music industry. In January, she will assume command of Universal Music Publishing Group: She is leaving Sony/ATV, where she was co-president and in charge of the company's West Coast office. Sony/ATV is the No. 1 music publisher, overseeing an estimated $1.2 billion in annual revenue, including EMI Music Publishing, for which it serves as administrator. Its chairman/CEO, Martin Bandier, has credited Gerson with building a writer-centric ethos there. She is well-known for spotting talent early. At Sony/ATV, she signed Lady Gaga, Norah Jones and Alicia Keys, who was just 15 when Gerson had the foresight to ink a deal.Gerson will tap that remarkable radar to spark a "cultural shift" at UMPG. She talks about marrying the company's business capabilities with A&R so that the creative nature is at the top. "Without having great talent and nurturing it, we are nothing," she says. "The challenge is to step out and be very involved in advocating for songwriters to make sure we add real value to their careers."UMPG's annual revenue is about $900 million. "We want to be the No. 1 music publisher," she says. "That doesn't mean market share. It means offering services to our songwriters and thinking outside the box to get the most value for their songs."Gerson, a single mother of three, knew she wanted to be in the music business from a young age. Her father owned a nightclub, the Latin Casino, in Cherry Hill, N.J., outside Philadelphia, where everyone from Frank Sinatra to Teddy Pendergrass played. "I grew up with a certain comfort level for the talent," she says. Her career began at Chappell Music, as an archivist in the company's sheet-music library. "I have always wanted to be in publishing, even though labels have called me now and then in the past.""Without having great talent and nurturing it, we are nothing," says Gerson.
