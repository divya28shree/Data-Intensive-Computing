Between 1945 and 1966, the Case Study Houses program, following the Weißenhof-siedlung exposition, commissioned a study of economic, easy-to-build houses. The study included the creation of 36 prototypes that were to be built leading up to post-war residential development. The initiative by John Entenza, editor of Arts & Architecture magazine, brought a team to Los Angeles that featured some of the biggest names in architecture at the time, including Richard Neutra, Charles & Ray Eames, Pierre Koenig, and Eero Saarinen, among others.Between 1945 and 1966, the Case Study Houses program, following the Weißenhof-siedlung exposition, commissioned a study of economic, easy-to-build houses.

Located in the city's Seine-Saint-Denis district, the village was designed to integrate with the existing urban fabric along the banks of the river. Combining housing and offices with diverse programs, the project spans over 119,000 square meters across its entirety. At the conclusion of the games, the village is designed to become a new permanent community in Paris.French architect Dominique Perrault has revealed the new masterplan and vision for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic village.

Home. Our shelter. Our private space. In an urbanized world with dense megalopolises like Tokyo, Shanghai, and São Paulo, homes are getting smaller and more expensive than ever. If you are claustrophobic, Marie Kondo is your best ally in the quest to earn some extra space.  And even though private backyards have become a luxury for most, our data shows that single-family houses are still the most popular project type on ArchDaily. Why is this? (Especially when it seems incongruous given the reality of today’s crowded cities.) Why do some universities still insist on designing and building houses as academic exercises? Wouldn’t it be more creative—and more useful—to develop architecture in small-scale spaces? Would it be more rewarding to develop solutions on bigger scales?Home. Our shelter. Our private space.

We shared PRAXIS’ ninth issue with you a few days ago, and we are excited to feature their tenth issue today. Entitled Urban Matters, this issue focuses on the challenges hyper-metropolises present – specifically, as editors Amanda Reeser Lawrence and Ashley Schafer comment in their introduction, how “to mediate between expansion and liveability” to define and shape the ever changing, and ever growing, urban condition. Architecture and the urban are encouraged to be in constant dialogue; an interconnected network which balances the macro “environmental, topographic, social/political, and technological” to form, and potentially, uplift the micro urban quality of our metropolises.We shared PRAXIS’ ninth issue with you a few days ago, and we are excited to feature their tenth issue today.

The article shares a brief chronology of how the city was formed and settled – first people occupied high elevations and then moved to the lower regions after the government added the necessary levee infrastructure. Mayne’s new vision sees residents transitioning back to the higher elevations, allowing the lower terrain to return to its natural state. Andrew Colopy terms this move the “reverse-engineering” of the area, and the article is a smooth transition from Jane Amidon’s Ecologue for the Metropolis which introduces several projects exploring “entrepreneurial environments” as a way for natural environments to complement the built developments of urban areas.

For instance, ordinary structures are transformed into ones that, in addition to functioning programatically, also address agricultural needs and even include wildlife circulation corridors. Ordinary structural pile systems now become host to an abundant ecosystem, building surfaces are faceted to include roof top vegetation and a home for birds, and interiors are fully “ecologized” with living wall papers.

Text description provided by the architects. The Agora Theatre is an extremely colourful, determinedly upbeat place. The building is part of the masterplan for Lelystad by Adriaan Geuze, which aims to revitalize the pragmatic, sober town centre. The theatre responds to the ongoing mission of reviving and recovering the post-war Dutch new towns by focusing on the archetypal function of a theatre: that of creating a world of artifice and enchantment. Both inside and outside walls are faceted to reconstruct the kaleidoscopic experience of the world of the stage, where you can never be sure of what is real and what is not. In the Agora theatre drama and performance are not restricted to the stage and to the evening, but are extended to the urban experience and to daytime.

The typology of the theatre is fascinating in itself, but Ben van Berkel, who has a special interest in how buildings communicate with people, aims to exploit the performance element of the theatre and of architecture in general far beyond its conventional functioning. As he recently stated: “The product of architecture can at least partly be understood as an endless live performance. As the architectural project transforms, becomes abstracted, concentrated and expanded, becomes diverse and evermore scaleless, all of this happens in interaction with a massive, live audience. Today, more than ever, we feel that the specificity of architecture is not itself contained in any aspect of the object. The true nature of architecture is found in the interaction between the architect, the object and the public. The generative, proliferating, unfolding effect of the architectural project continues beyond its development in the design studio in its subsequent public use.” (Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos, Design Models, Thames & Hudson, 2006).

The facetted outlines of the theatre have a long history in the work of UNStudio and Van Berkel & Bos Architectuurbureau before that. In this case, the envelope is generated in part by the necessity to place the two auditoriums as far apart from each other as possible for acoustic reasons. Thus, a larger and a smaller theatrical space, a stage tower, several interlinked and separate foyers, numerous dressing rooms, multifunctional rooms, a café and a restaurant are all brought together within one volume that protrudes dramatically in various directions. This facetted envelope also results in a more even silhouette; the raised technical block containing the stage machinery, which could otherwise have been a visual obstacle in the town, is now smoothly incorporated. All of the facades have sharp angles and jutting planes, which are covered by steel plates and glass, often layered, in shades of yellow and orange. These protrusions afford places where the spectacle of display is continued off-stage and the roles of performer and viewer may be reversed. The artists’s foyer, for instance, is above the entrance, enabling the artists to watch the audience approaching the theatre from a large, inclined window.

Inside, the colorfulness of the outside increases in intensity; a handrail executed as a snaking pink ribbon cascades down the main staircase, winds itself all around the void at the centre of the large, open foyer space on the first floor and then extends up the wall towards the roof, optically changing color all the while from violet, crimson and cherry to almost white. The main theatre is all in red. Unusually for a town of this size, the stage is very big, enabling the staging of large, international productions. The intimate dimensions of the auditorium itself are emphasized by the horse-shoe shaped balcony and by the vibrant forms and shades of the acoustic paneling.

The theatre is the most recent culmination of the interest Ben van Berkel has often expressed in exploring attractiveness, as this quotation from a recent publication shows: “The aim of our architecture  is to intensify the gaze, to inspire thoughts and images and thus make it attractive for people to stay longer and return to the places we make for them. Keeping it light and almost scientific is our policy; the ploys invented to intensify the gaze are directly related to the traditional ingredients of architecture: construction, light, circulation, and so on.” (Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos, After Image, 2006). The architect considers the Agora Theatre one of the most challenging projects he has undertaken, resulting in unusual and highly creative inventions, such as the handrail.

Text description provided by the architects. The Agora Theatre is an extremely colourful, determinedly upbeat place. The building is part of the masterplan for Lelystad by Adriaan Geuze, which aims to revitalize the pragmatic, sober town centre. The theatre responds to the ongoing mission of reviving and recovering the post-war Dutch new towns by focusing on the archetypal function of a theatre: that of creating a world of artifice and enchantment. Both inside and outside walls are faceted to reconstruct the kaleidoscopic experience of the world of the stage, where you can never be sure of what is real and what is not. In the Agora theatre drama and performance are not restricted to the stage and to the evening, but are extended to the urban experience and to daytime.Text description provided by the architects.

The approach was to use materials in appropriate ways – concrete and masonry where the building touches the earth, steel for height and span, and a light wood frame everywhere else, resulting in a hybrid system of steel primary members and wood secondary members. The design of the home sought to express as much of the steel and connections as possible.

The dramatic Southern elevation is centered on a three story curtain wall with a perforated steel screen for privacy. On the main living level, a skylight runs the length of the home on the North elevation, maximizing the passage of natural light, despite the building on the lot directly adjacent. The interior and exterior spaces seamlessly engage each other from a wide spanning bridge connecting the main living area to the garage roof deck, making efficient use of this Chicago city lot. The main living level is centered around the kitchen, an elevated area that functions as the command center for the home. The living room comfortably sits on one side of the kitchen, while the dining room sits on the opposite side.

Dividing the dining room from a home office at the front of the house, are three 12 foot tall steel doors hung on sliding tracks from the ceiling. The doors are inlaid with glass portholes of varied sizes and fondly referred to by the home owners as “Swiss cheese” doors. They easily slide away into a pocket allowing them to completely open the office to the rest of the living area. The lower level contains a two story rear foyer with a 18 foot tall wall of casework that’s height stretches into the living room, creating shelving to display objects and art above and storage for coats, gloves, hats and boots below. The lower level also contains a playroom, two guest suites and a home theater. The upper level features the family’s 3 bedroom suites and a small study. The stairs leading up to the roof deck are encased in glass and open to a private roof top garden with dazzling city views.

Text description provided by the architects. The site is a light industrial office park of conventional box buildings primarily from the 1960s and 1970s located in Topeka, Kansas. Cox Communications Distribution Center is the first building within the park to be renovated, as the owner has decided to revamp the entire park over the next several years. With a limited budget, the architects of el dorado were asked to create an innovative, yet simple tone for future development.Follow the break for more photographs and drawings of the new Cox Communications Distribution Center.

When the owner of a Topeka-based contemporary furniture-sales company inherited an outdated light industrial and office park from his father, he set forth to update the park, one building at a time. His first opportunity was created by the park’s anchor tenant, Cox Communications. Due to increased sales in the greater Topeka area, Cox Communications required a new distribution center for their growing inventory. In order to remain within the parameters of renewed lease terms, the owner developed a budget constraint of $80 per square foot.Many buildings surrounding the site are non-descript boxes.  Determined to create a new architectural language for the property, the owner hired el dorado inc to design the warehouse.  As a response to the budget constraints, el dorado inc immediately suggested to work with a pre-engineered metal building system.  After careful research of the system’s constraints and capabilities, a design direction was proposed to meet the project’s program, consisting mainly of an 8,500 square foot open floor plate warehouse.  The program also required an inventory check-out desk as well as a loading dock for incoming supplies.

The project solution, composed of a striking, yet elegant structural bays, implements sustainable strategies which aide in holding energy demands to a minimum.  A soaring cantilever completely shades the long, south metal wall system from the hot, Kansas summer sun.  The generous overhang also provides a sheltered loading and unloading area for service vans. A linear clerestory window allows indirect south light to flood the warehouse—the south shelving aisle does not require electric light during the day.  Linear louvered vents along the base of the north and south facades activate a convection cooling system, allowing outside air to enter the warehouse at floor level, replacing the hot air exiting the building through large roof vents.  Fully integrated fluorescent building lighting creates efficient expanses of indirect site illumination, eliminating the need for additional lighting parking lot pole-lights. Though small in area, the new distribution center for Cox Communications commands a large site presence through elegant proportions, crisp detailing, and smart energy conservation.

In 2008, BAC purchased an awkward, pre-existing 299-seat theater space within its building to house the new Jerome Robbins Theater, an intimate, state-of- the-art performance venue. The existing theater was contained within a concrete box and suffered from poor sightlines, poor acoustics, sub-standard theater technology, complicated circulation patterns, and an un-centered relationship between the audience and the stage.

think!’s redesign focused on optimizing the overall audience experience within the theater while resolving the technical and acoustical issues. Centralized raked seating for 238 audience members accommodates 187 in the orchestra and 51 in the floating balcony. Blue, Baryshnikov’s favorite color, was a natural choice for the color of the seats. Interlocking, sculptural staircases bordering the seating area link the orchestra and balcony levels, creating intuitive navigation and flow in a unified space. The sprung stage is set at floor level and measures 42’ wide by 28’ deep, making it ideal for dance as well as other types of performance. A minimal material and color palette was selected for the space—raw corten steel stair railings reflect the rough concrete walls, while perforated wood, acrylic panels, and carpet create a refined contrast.

Framed between the neoclassical Lillian Massey building to the north and the Queen Anne-style Margaret Addison Hall to the south, the renewal creates a bolder, more welcoming urban presence for the Gardiner. Inside, the interior is completely transformed to prioritize the display of the museum’s collections and to create a memorable, inviting visitor experience.

Inside, the interior is completely transformed to prioritize the display of the museum’s collections and to create a memorable, inviting visitor experience.The addition of approximately 14,000 s.f., creates a new contemporary gallery to host international exhibits of large-scale contemporary works, provides much-needed storage for the expanding permanent collection, and incorporates new studio and curatorial facilities to support the Gardiner’s popular community-outreach programs and its research activities. The design also greatly enhances the museum’s revenue-generating potential with a larger, more accessible retail shop, a rentable multi-purpose event space, and a destination restaurant run by Jamie Kennedy.

This exhibit also provided Kuwabara with an intimate understanding of the inner workings of the institution. When KPMB was selected as the architects for the renewal in 2001, Kuwabara’s first design move was to remove the main stair in the entrance hall. This opened up the ground floor to offer a more generous reception, an expanded museum shop and a new contemporary ceramics gallery. Vertical circulation between floors was shifted to the west with a new addition containing a public stair and passenger elevator. After this key shift, the team of Kuwabara, Blumberg and Rocha then developed an overall design strategy to respond to the Gardiner’s needs and vision for growth.In 2000, Bruce Kuwabara was invited by the Gardiner to design the exhibition Miró: Playing with Fire.

The limestone seamlessly weaves existing and expanded spaces together. Screens of limestone louvers control solar exposure into the upper floors of the west and south facades. The front of the museum is completely re-landscaped with a series of terraced platforms that provide a gradual ascent into the forecourt of the building.

Windows are positioned to provide visual breaks in the public spaces of the museum, and to draw attention to the surrounding context at different scales, from closeup views of the historic facades and pediments of the adjacent Lillian Massey and Margaret Addison buildings to framed sequences of the ROM’s heritage building and new Crystal expansion across the street. On the third floor, the multi-purpose space and terrace create elegant new ‘look out points’ that open on expansive vistas of Queen’s Park, the University of Toronto, and the downtown skyline.

Text description provided by the architects. Located at Trial Bay overlooking the D’Entrecasteaux Channel, the project required an addition of a new living room, verandah, courtyard and garage, along with complete reorganization of the existing dwelling which was built in 1981 and designed by Ray Heffernan.  The new room is projected toward the Channel, in a manner and position that preserves the outlook from the house, and maximises direct sunlight to, and outlook from both. The house was awarded the prestigious 2010 Robin Boyd Award of Australian Institute of Architects. 
Save this picture!
The new architecture departs from the existing ‘holes in walls’ masonry character by achieving the duality of being extroverted and open to the landscape, yet being solid, strong and robust.  Close collaboration between architect and structural engineer ensured smooth fabrication and erection of the precast concrete wall/roof panels for the Channel Room. The panels were workshop formed to control the quality of the natural concrete finish. 
Save this picture!
The existing dwelling’s gable form, external wall lines and timber ceiling were retained. However all internal walls, internal and external openings and all surfaces and fitments have been changed.  Double glazed sliding timber windows and doors combine with tiled floors, solar collectors, integral hot water heating, cross ventilation and rainwater harvesting to achieve an acceptable level of environmental performance, without remote control. 
Save this picture!
Door and window frames are fabricated from select Celery Top Pine, with a secondary jamb to create cross ventilation slots.  All joinery has been fabricated with marine ply for cupboard interiors, and finished with Celery Top Pine veneer doors with solid strikes and edges.  An embedded idea is the creation of a pattern of continuous space and circulation, as a metaphor for the landscape itself.

Defining the City The construction of a city involves how is it defined, understood and experienced. These processes and definitions diverge wildly depending upon one’s location: East or West. Heretofore, western architects have subjected analysis of “The City” in China, indeed all of Asia, to a set of western-privileging universals for both physical and epistemological constructions.

More after the break.For one, cities in the western context are understood and conceived as continuities, grounded in specific historical notions of civilization and progress towards a western-defined “modernity”. The city was therefore evidence of a particular kind of progress, the real-ization of that progress, the “real.” Buildings and streets provides critical evidence of an advanced civilization; it is the summary proof of superiority and mastery over nature. Cities thus define the logical, scientific culmination of civilization’s advance and the inevitable teleological development of western culture (1).

Cities thus define the logical, scientific culmination of civilization’s advance and the inevitable teleological development of western culture (1).We must understand, however, that experiences of Western cities have emerged from radically different historical circumstances that are both defined by and juxtaposed with the current “pre-modernity” of China and Asia (2). For Westerners apprehending the rapid changes in the built city, it is difficult to reconcile a “premodern, ancient, grand China” with the contemporary Chinese city of endless permutations, of mirrored curtain walls and fiber optics. In the language of Rem Koolhaas, Chinese cities are “Cities of Exacerbated Difference” or COED (3). This condition is characterized by growth that causes cities to seemingly explode into zones of radical difference. In this scenario, one area neither resembles nor carries the territorial logic of its neighbor.

Moreover, the implicit critique, almost a lament, is that Chinese cities were once unified totalities, devoid of internal difference and anchored architecturally by a predominant “traditional” style of building. The current paradigm has scarred the “pure” territory of the city with “imported” styles (4). The logical end of this argument is that the “true” identity of the Chinese city should remain rooted in the past; only the West can define modernity and progress.

Again, this assessment fails to recognize that Chinese cities have not erased their past. Rather, the past is fully integrated with the present: it is thus mutable. The signs of the past are internalized rather than built as fixed monuments (6). In essence, the built environment is not the primary conduit to or indication of history. Instead, material culture provides merely one element to mark progression. The true signifier of historical continuity is not material but rather, is written—in dynastic histories, edicts, philosophical tracts and commentary. In short, Chinese language, not buildings, is the primary marker of culture. Another view, that of Dutch architect Neville Mars, asserts that China has erased its past (5).

Sinology is selectively farmed for ideas that support decontextualized critiques of contemporary China (8). In a material sense, much of the drama in China-as-contemporary-progress-run-amok is grounded in the mis-perception of China as a rural-based culture. Historical evidence points to the contrary: China, for most of it’s history, was comprised of urban networks.

These are rooted in 18th century Enlightenment concepts in which China perpetually occupies the space of the past, a supposed antithesis of western progress that assumes (and proves) western superiority in those aspects of culture deemed most valuable (10). The orientalist articulation and calibration of the ”other” places the other in the position of inferiority and requires accuracy and legitimacy to be conferred by western intellectuals (11).

The orientalist articulation and calibration of the ”other” places the other in the position of inferiority and requires accuracy and legitimacy to be conferred by western intellectuals (11).Yet the notion of “pre-modernity” not only privileges a particular type of physical and concomitant intellectual development, but it also presumes the West as the standard (12). Such labeling assumes that all “pre-modern” societies desire identical teleological processes towards modernity modeled on Europe and the U.S. Measuring China according to Western ideas of progress privileges the West which produces a history by the West for and about China (13). China as a philosophical construction, or category, in the West serves as a formulation of antithetical, pre-modern “other” that proves the superiority of western modernity (14).

Moreover, because western cities will always occupy successful modernity, pre-modern societies will necessarily be suspect in their advancement towards a derived modernization. In essence, this is the continuation of colonialism’s conception of center and periphery with all that implies.

The message: “look at how they are ruining their once beautiful traditional cities by incorrectly deploying what we’ve taught them about Progress”—this being the orientalist fantasy of China as exotic specter on the verge of catastrophe.

This questions whether or not all modernities contain varying degrees of hybridization. China, like many societies, shops for those technologies which suit their material progress. Those are combined with indigenous principles and philosophies, producing a result that does not reaffirm the singular Western timeline from pre-modern to modernity.

China has brought our own skeletons out of the closet. Western observers can displace onto China their own fears about the dark side of established, western forms of progress and what this might entail for their own cities (16). Instead, we must acknowledge that new forms of progress can and do emerge from the new conditions in urban China.

The architectural discourse on China, for example, is a glaring example of the continuation of old modes of coming to terms with the Other. In order for architecture to grasp China’s present it must shift its narratives away from tendencies which “traditionalize” China’s unique modernity.

The western concept of the city has been to large degree informed by the philosophy of progress as described by Hegel, in which he describes the trajectory of western history, in terms of progress, as inevitably leading to the advance of civilization. Hegel’s notion of progress places the West, as a metaphysical category, in opposition to the East, or the Oriental world. The West’s ability to form a globe-spanning imperium is evidence of its superiority. Hegel’s philosophy was also informed by a Protestant belief in progress as evidence of God’s will. (Hegel, G.W.F. (Rauch, Leo, tr.) Introduction to the Philosophy of History). 2. This progress, read linearly, culminates necessarily in the West as the apex of development, wherein all other cultures occupy an anterior time, a time “out of history” that marks them as “pre-modern” rather than having made a choice to be non-modern as defined by Western thought (see McClintock on anterior time, 1995). 3. A term first copyrighted by Koolhass, et al in Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping, 2001. 4. For a discussion of style in the Chinese city see Peter G. Rowe, 2002. 5. The Chinese Dream: A Society Under Transformation (forthcoming). Again, what is most important about such texts is that they stand apart and at a great distance from China. This is the crux of orientalism. What the text says, in fact, has more to do with the author than with China’s urban condition. It is important to note that the discipline of architecture in the west has constructed its own version of China and that this is in large part informed by very conservative and out of date views. While the humanities has recently adjusted its approach to how it formulates and conceptualizes China, the intellectual discourse of architecture has lagged behind, having not yet caught up theoretically. It is in a sense, riding the coattails of the “China phenomenon” to produce special effects, a spectacle that in fact more reflects the obsessions and concerns of distant witnesses. This is the second China that has always stood apart from the first. The appendage that China cannot shed because western commentary insists that this stand-in is the real thing. In this sense, China is compelled to be like the Siamese twins, Chang and Eng. If we look at the city in literature, for example, Italo Calvino’s Invisible Cities exhibits a city as a multiplicity of mental constructs that all coexist. This heterogeneous nature is in essence the very marker of what a city is, the gathering place of multiple existences and states of being. Ironically, however, Chinese cities have been denied this multiple aspect by much of western urban discourse and are often leveled into simplistic depictions of physical and political turmoil in opposition to tranquil traditionalism. More nuanced depictions of Chinese cities are to be found in contemporary Chinese literature and film (add examples). 6. Part of reason for this misunderstanding is based on the fact that the specialized and popular knowledge base of orientalism has rendered cities like Beijing as fixed in the past and therefore their monuments are foregrounded above all else. Monuments, then, come to embody the city. The past-located exotic foreign capital is based on monuments while the forward moving post-modern city of the west is determined by an ethos of material and social progress. 7.

Shih, 2001,371-377. 12. Ibid. 13. See Chakrabarty 1992. 14. As described by Shih (2001) the Orientalizing of China as exotic other was a crucial element in the formation of modernity and in fact made modernity possible. This came about by means of an aesthetic and scientific appropriation of China for the purposes of consumption in the west. In this sense, the commodification of culture Jameson speaks of as a defining element of western postmodern culture had already taken place in reference to China as category, or fetish. Chinese culture as image, object, exotic subject was employed as an energizing agent for western cultural transformation. 15. For more on the concept of the non-modern see Prakash, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996. This rejects a linear progression through history from pre-modern to modern as typified by the west. It also rejects what McClintock (1995) calls historical progress as geography, wherein the farther “west” you travel the further up the modernity chain you travel (progress not merely as time but as spatial construct.) 16. A case in point is the horror over the Three Gorges Dam project in which western critiques of China’s dam policies stand in as a post-horror of the destruction wrought by the TVA and in which hundreds of dams were erected and irreversibly transformed the North American landscape. See Reisner, 1986. 1. The western concept of the city has been to large degree informed by the philosophy of progress as described by Hegel, in which he describes the trajectory of western history, in terms of progress, as inevitably leading to the advance of civilization. Hegel’s notion of progress places the West, as a metaphysical category, in opposition to the East, or the Oriental world. The West’s ability to form a globe-spanning imperium is evidence of its superiority. Hegel’s philosophy was also informed by a Protestant belief in progress as evidence of God’s will. (Hegel, G.W.F. (Rauch, Leo, tr.) Introduction to the Philosophy of History). 2. This progress, read linearly, culminates necessarily in the West as the apex of development, wherein all other cultures occupy an anterior time, a time “out of history” that marks them as “pre-modern” rather than having made a choice to be non-modern as defined by Western thought (see McClintock on anterior time, 1995). 3. A term first copyrighted by Koolhass, et al in Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping, 2001. 4. For a discussion of style in the Chinese city see Peter G. Rowe, 2002. 5. The Chinese Dream: A Society Under Transformation (forthcoming). Again, what is most important about such texts is that they stand apart and at a great distance from China. This is the crux of orientalism. What the text says, in fact, has more to do with the author than with China’s urban condition. It is important to note that the discipline of architecture in the west has constructed its own version of China and that this is in large part informed by very conservative and out of date views. While the humanities has recently adjusted its approach to how it formulates and conceptualizes China, the intellectual discourse of architecture has lagged behind, having not yet caught up theoretically. It is in a sense, riding the coattails of the “China phenomenon” to produce special effects, a spectacle that in fact more reflects the obsessions and concerns of distant witnesses. This is the second China that has always stood apart from the first. The appendage that China cannot shed because western commentary insists that this stand-in is the real thing. In this sense, China is compelled to be like the Siamese twins, Chang and Eng.

When we stopped by Steven Holl’s office in New York, Senior Partner Chris McVoy spoke to us about the firm’s latest project in Hangzhou – an International Tourism Complex. The firm has a growing presence in China and, arguably, some of the team’s strongest works (such as their Linked Hybrid and Horizontal Skyscraper) are situated throughout the region. With their most recent win, the firm will redevelop the site of the oxygen and boiler plants in Hangzhou to create a master plan comprised of residential and cultural components.When we stopped by Steven Holl’s office in New York, Senior Partner Chris McVoy spoke to us about the firm’s latest project in Hangzhou – an International Tourism Complex.

Text description provided by the architects. The Yew Dell Gardens Visitor Center is situated within the historic property of the Garden Conservancy.  The project required the rehabilitation of an existing tobacco barn with a program including a reception area, information and tickets sales, gift shop, plant sale area, group tour meeting zone, internet sales office, and storage.  De Leon & Primmer Architecture Workshop were challenged with a modest construction budget of $64/sqf and a tight 5 month design and construction completion schedule.  This design project was awarded a 2010 AIA Kentucky Honor Award.

Preserving the exterior iconic image of the tobacco barn structure, the new facility is designed as a ‘building-within-a-building’.  For economy and energy efficiency, the project utilizes the shell of the existing barn as an independent shade structure, leaving it essentially unaltered with the exception of minor framing stabilization. Working with existing structural bay modules, new conditioned interior spaces are consolidated to one side of the barn interior while unconditioned spaces are designed as covered flexible-use areas.  During low-humidity spring & fall seasons, frameless glass doors can be left open to merge both halves of the barn.  Following state historic preservation guidelines, new construction is clearly differentiated from the existing structure through light-colored interior wood plank surfaces and material contrasts.

The use of light - both natural & artificial - is a key design element that transforms the facility throughout the day, affecting the transparency and visibility of the various programmatic components while amplifying the rustic characteristics of the existing tobacco barn. Acting as either a mirror or a transparent boundary depending on the viewing angle, tempered glass walls reflect & refract sunlight, views, and outer barn walls, emphasizing a sense of spaciousness while allowing the original barn to visually register within interior spaces.  During the evening, the facility becomes a glowing lantern within the gardens, with the outer barn shell expressed though interior light filtering through gaps between the wood siding.

Rooted in the simplicity of regional farm structures and in concert with the client’s priorities for responsible stewardship of the land, the farm complex utilizes simple, passive sustainable approaches that are specifically based on an understanding of the regional climate and the nuances of the landscape. For reasons of both economy and ease of maintenance, sustainable building strategies are decidedly ‘low-tech’, favoring conventional construction methods & ordinary materials over specialized systems. In particular, the project implements strategies that take advantage of the cross-synergies between site & building design, focusing on a holistic approach where both components work as a single integrated system.

Consolidating the various programmatic elements into two large barn buildings and a grain silo (in order to minimize building footprints), the majority of the project site is allocated to the circulation & access requirements of large-scale farm equipment. Because facility water usage is minimal and site landscaping is limited to native & regionally-adapted plants that do not require irrigation, site-wide stormwater strategies focus on returning runoff to replenish local aquifers. Porous, drivable gravel surfaces are pitched to channel stormwater into two ‘rain gardens’ planted with native vegetation. Excess run-off is collected within these basins and allowed to percolate back into the groundwater table. In order to minimize maintenance, building roof gutters are eliminated and replaced with ‘site gutters’, a system of drivable, shallow concrete channel swales aligned below each roof eave, which direct stormwater to the collection basins.

Detail
The two primary buildings (Barn ‘A’ and Barn ‘B’) are arranged to frame an outdoor work courtyard, allowing for the consolidation of outdoor lighting requirements to an internalized site zone and away from the farm complex property perimeter, preserving ‘dark sky’ conditions.Barn ‘A’, with fully enclosed storage & work areas, utilizes a standard prefabricated wood truss frame clad with corrugated metal panels. Emphasizing the layering of construction, building elements that are typically hidden (such as wall substrates, fastening screws & alignment lines) are incorporated as design features and reinterpreted as ‘finish’ materials. Natural light, ventilation and views are provided to all interior spaces through full-height operable windows which working in concert with a whole-house fan to draw air through the building.

Barn ‘B’, a large covered shed used to store both hay & equipment, is clad in a lattice grid of locally-harvested bamboo sourced only 35 miles from the project site. Considered a fast-growing invasive ‘weed’, the bamboo is a material nod to the square-bale hay that is stacked at each end of the barn, while also providing a breathable skin that allows the hay to dry through natural ventilation. Since Barn ‘B’ is an open-air structure vulnerable to wind-uplift forces, the concrete drainage channels below its roof eaves also function as a counterweight through an interlocking detail with the column concrete footings below grade.

Although the project is grounded primarily on passive heating & cooling strategies, several conventional mechanical approaches are used during extreme climate conditions like humid summer months. They include the following: In-slab hot-water coils heated with a wood-fired boiler (renewable energy source from onsite agriculture waste wood) with propane fuel back-up, whole-house ventilation fan, inverter-controlled ductless split system AC unit (a non-CFC-based refrigerant), florescent light fixtures on IR sensors & timers with manual override, low-flow toilet & low-volume water fixtures integrated to an adjacent septic field.

Text description provided by the architects. Winnipeg Centennial Library was originally constructed in 1976 as a three-story building occupying a city block and an adjacent public park.  The existing library, constructed of reinforced concrete exposed to the interior and pre-cast panel exterior, felt very disconnected from its surroundings including the park.  The addition to the library, which began in 2002 as the winning entry in an invited design competition, includes reorganization and expansion of the collections, reconfiguration of the circulation systems, and creation of new social spaces, as well as renovation of the existing library.

Both the existing library, roughly triangular in plan, and green space stand on a below-grade parking garage.  Expanding the library into the park would have destroyed valuable public green space and required costly foundation reinforcement within the parking garage. An alternative was to extend the library upward. Fortunately, the building had the structural capacity to accept an additional floor, provided it was light in weight; it also needed to be re-roofed. Thus, most of the added space is contained in a new, light, steel-framed fourth floor under a new roof.

Because of severe winter conditions, many of the buildings in downtown Winnipeg are linked by a continuous interior tunnel and skywalk system. The library is connected to this system by bridges at the second level. An enlarged two-story lobby, created by removing a portion of the second floor, allows the street-level entrance to the library, as well as a gift shop and café within the lobby, to interconnect with the skywalk.

From this urban intersection, patrons are drawn through the building, along an interior “street” animated by displays and bookselling events, and to the park. At the park edge, new public elevators and an elongated system of stairs and reading terraces tie the largely independent existing floors to each other and to the new fourth floor. The glazed wall of this multi-story space opens every level to light, landscape, and city. All public and collections space is accessible from this linear route. The compact footprint of the addition maintains maximum park space, allowing the library to take advantage of its location, while the highly visible, interactive terraces, an interior topography at the scale of the park, generate a radically new identity for the library.

The library is ordered in strips, in a series of zones that run parallel to the window wall and across the long dimension of the space. The strips accommodate the programmatic components of the library in identifiable categories. The first strip is the park, an integral part of all public spaces in the building. The second is all forms of reading—tables, comfortable chairs, and casual seating. Third is low masses, such as reference collections, help desks, and computer stations, and fourth is high masses, such as shelving running in clear sequences. The fifth category comprises rooms: closed reading rooms, offices and meeting rooms, staff areas, service areas, and book handling access. The strips progress from park to interior, from open to enclosed, from low to high, from areas of greatest public access and interaction to areas of privacy and quiet. This spatial order allows all visitors to see and understand the general arrangement of collections and functions whether they approach from elevators or from reading terraces and stairs.

On the new fourth floor, the non-fiction collection is organized as a single run of clearly indexed material. Various subjects within the collection are highlighted by “focus” areas. These exhibit spaces, which are immediately visible at the entrance to the floor, are intervals inserted into the continuity of the collection to emphasize subjects often submerged within the numerical anonymity of the Dewey Decimal system.

The Aquatic Ecosystems Research Laboratory is located on the northern side of the courtyard. This 5,150 square meter building consolidates interdisciplinary research groups around an atrium that interconnects the four floors of the building. Social spaces are located adjacent to this atrium to reinforce a sense of academic community and to encourage serendipitous interaction between faculty, students and the various research units. Faculty offices, loft spaces / digital laboratories for the student community and a variety of meeting spaces are located on the upper floors, while the large public rooms are located on the ground floor where they participate in the urban life of the campus.

The atrium plays a key role in the sustainable design strategies employed in the Aquatic Ecosystems Research Laboratory. Glazed at the top to bring day-light deep into the interior it combines with generous glazing on the north side of the building and photo sensor controls to minimize dependency on artificial lighting. The atrium also acts as a natural ventilation stack that pulls air into the building, eliminating the need for a conventional mechanical ventilation system. On summer nights the building is naturally ventilated to cool the concrete structure, which acts as a radiant cooling surface during the day, eliminating the need for air conditioning for the three upper floors. The Aquatic Ecosystems Research Laboratory is certified LEED Gold.

“The University of Leicester Engineering Building, the History Faculty and Library at Cambridge, and the residential Florey Building at Queen’s College are much praised by architects, yet hated by the members of the universities that use them. Here Alan Berman has drawn together essays that put the buildings in their historical context while exploring both their radical features and their technical failings. In addition, 22 of today’s most famous architects — including Will Alsop, Norman Foster, Richard MacCormac, and Richard Rogers — explain and partly seek to defend the importance of these radical and controversial buildings. With top contributors and newly commissioned photography, as well as stunning drawings taken from the Jim Stirling archives, this book attempts a serious reengagement with the continuing debate between modern architects and the public.”“The University of Leicester Engineering Building, the History Faculty and Library at Cambridge, and the residential Florey Building at Queen’s College are much praised by architects, yet hated by the members of the universities that use them.

Text description provided by the architects. Concept: The concept of project windows is derived from the idea of traditional Iranian windows (Orosi). These windows consist of small colourful modules of glass that control the intensity of light penetrating inside and create a colourful light and shadow on the inner surfaces.

As the building is narrow in width in comparison to its height, the whole complex is divided into several parts in width and height to gain a balanced proportion. Therefore an initially gained rectangular module is composing the whole form on the main façade. These modules are conveying functions such as the entrance, office and commercial units. Our next task was to design a texture on this transparent façade and the containing modules based on the concept of expanding geometry; an Iranian architectural concept in which one module becomes a base for the formation of a whole complex.

The Idea of Dynamic Urban façade: Light is a significant variable in the facade design of this building. By using the transparent and semi-transparent textures on the glass facade we were able to create different qualities of light with various reflection and angles in the night and day. The night light was also modified through using the artificial lighting system that is in harmony with the form of the building and magnifies the dynamic urban views. Through using this modulation system and the facade design we tried to bring an Iranian theme in interior space with the effect of shadows and turquoise reflection of the modules installed on façade. This effect is always being felt even when the semi-transparent blinds are closed.

Exterior Material Combination: The north and south façade of the building contains two transparent layers of material. The first one includes the same size rectangular modules that are installed with small steel rods and includes the main windows. The outer shell is a 30 by 30 glass module that is covered with sky blue colour inspired by Iranian architectural theme. This outer layer not only brings a colourful effect of shadows and lights inside, but also creates a thermal and light shield for the sharp sunlight of the southern façade. The inner layer of the facade in some parts transforms to a semi-transparent layer that is textured by double glazed windows with sand blast modular patterns on inside. Overall, the main goal of this material combination was to reduce the temperature gained by sunlight about 40%. This climatic need is also modified by using the Sun Energy type of glass windows.

Plan Typology: Site is a 13.5 m by 20 m rectangle in total 16 stories. In this project building two underground floors are allocated to mechanical and service rooms. Ground and first floors are dedicated to commercial units and the upper 12 floors are the official units. The client was eager to have different types of office units with the areas ranged from 50 m2 to 120 m2 .This requirement divides each floor into 2 up to 4 units designed with different areas and facilities but regardless of interior quality of space.

Interior Design Strategy: Natural light in the interiors are absorbed from the main facade windows and series of linear transparent and semi-transparent partitions of glass bricks are installed aligned with the transparent facade windows. This strategy not only creates a unity between the interior and exterior but also transfers the natural light in to the deeper interior spaces.

The night light was also modified through using the artificial lighting system that is in harmony with the form of the building and magnifies the dynamic urban views. Through using this modulation system and the facade design we tried to bring an Iranian theme in interior space with the effect of shadows and turquoise reflection of the modules installed on façade. This effect is always being felt even when the semi-transparent blinds are closed.Exterior Material Combination: The north and south façade of the building contains two transparent layers of material. The first one includes the same size rectangular modules that are installed with small steel rods and includes the main windows. The outer shell is a 30 by 30 glass module that is covered with sky blue colour inspired by Iranian architectural theme. This outer layer not only brings a colourful effect of shadows and lights inside, but also creates a thermal and light shield for the sharp sunlight of the southern façade. The inner layer of the facade in some parts transforms to a semi-transparent layer that is textured by double glazed windows with sand blast modular patterns on inside. Overall, the main goal of this material combination was to reduce the temperature gained by sunlight about 40%. This climatic need is also modified by using the Sun Energy type of glass windows.Exterior Material Combination: The north and south façade of the building contains two transparent layers of material.

In this project building two underground floors are allocated to mechanical and service rooms. Ground and first floors are dedicated to commercial units and the upper 12 floors are the official units. The client was eager to have different types of office units with the areas ranged from 50 m2 to 120 m2 .This requirement divides each floor into 2 up to 4 units designed with different areas and facilities but regardless of interior quality of space.Plan Typology: Site is a 13.5 m by 20 m rectangle in total 16 stories.

Text description provided by the architects. The urban biophillic pavilion, designed by studio d'ARC, is located atop a nineteenth century row house in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The pavilion is a reconstruction of a rooftop greenhouse originally built in 1978. The new pavilion serves as both a garden and common room with indoor and outdoor areas including deck platforms with spectacular views. More photographs and drawings following the break.

This rooftop biophillic pavilion is located in the South Side neighborhood of Pittsburgh, in an area known as “the flats”. This area is a geological product of the alluvial basin of the Monongahela River. This unique basin allows for long vistas and is endowed with ample sunlight. These environmental features made this neighborhood one of Pittsburgh’s oldest developed areas and was an early home for many of the city’s glass and later steel making facilities. The South Side experienced the most rapid growth as a dense residential district of mainly row houses in the later part of the nineteenth century built to provide housing for the workers of the steelmaking industry.

Located atop a nineteenth century row house, the pavilion is a reconstruction of a rooftop greenhouse originally built in 1978 by Ernie and Jan Sota. Inspired by the early bioshelter work of the New Alchemy Institute on Cape Cod and using solar greenhouse principals of steep south face glazing, the original greenhouse was one of Pittsburgh’s first green building projects. The 1978 structure allowed the owners to garden year-round in a dense urban context which did not provide for any ground level plantings. Fresh air and in the winter, excess heat and greenhouse fragrance were delivered to the apartments below through a recycled furnace blower motor.

Made mainly of conventionally framed lumber, wood siding and Kalwall, the greenhouse, after years of continual use, was in need of replacement. The new pavilion’s structural enclosure is similar conceptually to the Russian “Matryoshka” nested dolls -- “a structure within a structure”. The main supporting structure is within and is made of exposed douglas fir while the outside enclosure is made of standard wood construction, glass and terne coated stainless steel. The new structure is built to last using aluminum sloped glazing, insulated glass and stainless steel siding and roofing and uses the same “solar” greenhouse configuration as the original.

In its new form, the pavilion serves as a biophillic garden with hydroponic gardening for the tenants with both indoor and outdoor areas. The pavilion now acts as a common room for the tenants that they can use year-round and includes two outside deck platforms which allow for spectacular views of the South Side flats and slopes, Mt. Washington, and Downtown Pittsburgh. Besides the stunning views that can be seen both from the decks and within through the large windows, the pavilion again provides a space to grow flowers and vegetables using a combination of organic hydroponics and soil.

The pavilion will also act as a supplemental heat source for the apartments (for both heating and hot water). Excess heat from the pavilion and warm earth and plant fragrances are circulated to the apartments below during the winter months. When excess heat is not available or during more temperate weather, filtered intake air is taken directly from the exterior. Intake and exhaust air travels through an energy recovery ventilator (ERV), which will capture 90% of the energy from the ventilated air. The diagram at right shows how fresh air will be captured and sent to the apartments below. This ERV “chimney” or “Urban Snorkel” is a deliberate strategy to capture air up as high as possible to deliver to the apartments. The resultant positive air pressure on the apartments prevents infiltration of the lower quality street level air. Future plans also call for a solar domestic hot water heating system as well as upgrades to the air filtration system to deal with particulates, NO2 and SO2, which are common urban pollutants.

As part of its reconstruction and to demonstrate the owners’ long-standing interest in environmentally friendly building methods and materials, this pavilion integrates many current environmental solutions. The north and south decks use TREX, a high recycled content decking material. Recycled content drywall and recycled ceramic tile are used within the structure. The two outdoor spaces have railings made of recycled content galvanized steel, nontoxic pressure treated framing and TREX decking which provide integrated seating platforms and planting boxes. Greenery is further celebrated through the installation of supersized window boxes at the second floor windows of the building.

Text description provided by the architects. Located along the St. Lawrence river, between the Sillery coast and the Ross coast (towards Quebec's bridge), the project delicately weaves a sequence of diverse experiences and atmospheres, navigating from the boundless visual expanse of the river and the scale of the territory, to the tactile sensory experiences of the human scale. The first concern in this project was to inhibit the motorway system which crossed the ground over its length; the second, was to try to make comfortable this immense space by looking after the concepts of scales and balance, but also while giving a special attention to use local materials and vegetation on the site.

An immense cycle track and a sinuous pedestrian path cross this longitudinal site bringing the user from a cultural pole at one end, to a sport pole at the centre and an interpretation pole at the other end. The journey is punctuated by pieces of contemporary art that interact with the landscape and the urban design. The cultural section of the project gathers four contemporary gardens inspired by the mood of the river - the Quai des brumes, the Quai ds flots, the Quai des hommes and the Quai des vents. The sport section, at the center, is composed by two ground soccer, big open spaces and a multipurpose track. The last section of the project, looking towards Quebec's bridge, is set around an industrial quay rehabilitated to gather services of interpretation and restoration. Composed of an observation tower, a deck connected to the river and a multifunctional pavilion, this section marks an important entry to the site and revives the imaginary of a river pier and its intrinsic structures, turning it into a local visual anchor and light beacon - a significant newcomer to the constellation of industrial relics dominating local landscape silhouette and vistas. Finally, behind sector of Cageux, we find a natural site composed of Amerindian archaeological vestiges and centenaries aboriginal trees. This section is integrated to the rest of the Promenade and has been designed in the continuity of the whole project.

The rich, sublime atmospheres and layered textures of the St. Lawrence River's landscapes are materialised as much with stone boulders, timber assemblies and corten steel thresholds, as with native plants and trees, and as with vapour haze, thick shade, mellow light glows and water reflections. The language is contemporary, simple and elegant. The use of familiar material such as rough wood and local stones and the consolidation of the existing shoreline vegetation give an authentic flavour to these contemporary creations. The reinvigorated vegetation frames views and trajectories, and calibrates spaces and scales.

Respectfully remaining within the historic footprints of the original spirit of the shoreline, the project connects Quebec City with the riversides and with the other coastal cities. It also connects the city with XXI century values and vision. The bicycle networks on both sides of the river and the activity around the belvedere space (future boat connections) strongly contributes to revitalise an important section of the Lawrence River's borders and brings important wellness and economics repercussions to the city and its surroundings.

The innovation on this project stands on how designers manage to push the highway further away, how they were able to release an important piece of land in order to reactivates Quebec City's access to St. Lawrence River and transforms this part of the shoreline into a new inviting and user-friendly environment oriented towards nature, leisure and art. The subtle way the whole project integrates the highway and helps qualify this big infrastructure into a landscaped piece of work allows users to cross and drivers to stop. The project, that qualifies Champlain Boulevard from a highway into a landscaped, permeable urban boulevard, is a strong contribution to the restoration of the uniquely rich and diverse, albeit fragile coastal eco-system. Preserved and integrated as living heritage, the existing vegetation has been consolidated and complemented throughout the scheme by species native to St. Lawrence shoreline natural environment.

Text description provided by the architects. The "Rechter House" in Tel Aviv was originally designed by Zeev Rechter as a single storey home for his family with an orderly arrangement of internally and externally exposed, longitudinal concrete beams which formed the basis for the internal spaces, whilst adhering to the principles of "open planning" that were prevalent in those years. Over the years, an extra floor and a third wing were added to the building in such a way that its original form was hidden and the modern design principles governing its original design were abandoned. As the project's designer, I was asked to cope with a situation where the house had been stripped of its original ideas, disconnected from all of its parts and been used by two, separate families.

The family that purchased this old and neglected building asked me to design them a home that united all of the parts of the dwelling into one, new fully integrated living unit, both in terms of its function and its design style. The main idea behind the project wasn't necessarily to preserve the existing habitat and its configuration, but rather to conserve the spirit of the original design. With this in mind, I redesigned the house's external features and internal spaces.

I preserved the horizontal grid and gave it extra intensity when I divided it into two halves through the use of a spacious double space running its entire length. Within the space, I placed a stair case that consolidated all the masses of the structure into one single unit with a huge bookcase along the entire wall that further emphasized the double space. I zealously preserved the original concrete beams and the broad schematic of the building. The design and placement of all internal spaces, functions and rooms was integrated so as not to deviate from the horizontal grid. I also addressed all the external walls of the house. I made new openings that allowed views from both the outside into the home and from the inside out.

This was done in order to emphasize the length of the lines and the different architectural elements. On the long façade fronting the street, I allowed for a dialogue between the structure and the street by installing vertical, aluminum leaves that move on an axis and allow for a visual connection between the residents of the house and pedestrians in the street, and a blurring of the barrier between the private and the public. The movement of the leaves allows light to enter at differing angles during the day and thus brings life and drama into the highly organized spaces and the restrained architecture.

The choice of materials (such as the concrete floor and exposed concrete beams, iron stairs and railings that underwent a prolonged process of rusting, the repeated usage of the original silicate blocks and various metals placed at differing intervals) was done with great thought and included materials that are not considered "fashionable" so that they will not overpower the architecture and will help form a bridge between the two era's; the first, the original one storey design and the other the new, present day design. With the new design, I tried to write or present a personal and updated version of a private dwelling in the spirit of the modern era and in an international style.

The final result of the architectural design and the new interior design is a reserved and cultured private home with human proportions and spaces that together form a strong and clear form, free of unnecessary decorations and designer "chit-chat" with a clean and moderate form and ideas, that reflect the architectural and social principals that are so difficult to find in today's modern world.

On the long façade fronting the street, I allowed for a dialogue between the structure and the street by installing vertical, aluminum leaves that move on an axis and allow for a visual connection between the residents of the house and pedestrians in the street, and a blurring of the barrier between the private and the public. The movement of the leaves allows light to enter at differing angles during the day and thus brings life and drama into the highly organized spaces and the restrained architecture.The choice of materials (such as the concrete floor and exposed concrete beams, iron stairs and railings that underwent a prolonged process of rusting, the repeated usage of the original silicate blocks and various metals placed at differing intervals) was done with great thought and included materials that are not considered "fashionable" so that they will not overpower the architecture and will help form a bridge between the two era's; the first, the original one storey design and the other the new, present day design. With the new design, I tried to write or present a personal and updated version of a private dwelling in the spirit of the modern era and in an international style.

Text description provided by the architects. In the shadow of the cathedral the protected building is since the 17th century pharmacy and a home. Expand wishes for the pharmacy made looking to expand the house. To connect the adjoining apartment to the attic floor offers the solution. Intensive discussions with the service heritage results in a integration into the sensitive historic urban texture.

Shed roofs are connecting the bays of the historical roof trusses with the side lying flat. They bring light and space in the heart of the new house. The support functions of the house are grouped in the former apartment. This makes the attic fully opened and the trusses are restored to their value as defining elements in the space. Two contemporary sink dormer give the house a new identity restored. They open the closeness of the attic without compromising the historical character of the city.

This article was originally published on November 9, 2015. To read the stories behind other celebrated architecture projects, visit our AD Classics section. Angkor Wat is just one of dozens of extant Khmer temples in the Angkor area of present-day Cambodia, but it represents the apex of a building tradition that spanned five centuries, and the height of Khmer power and influence in the region. It is the largest temple complex at Angkor, and intricate bas-relief sculptures line the sandstone structures exemplify the apex of Khmer artistry. Although it has been in continuous use since its construction in the twelfth century, aspects of its history remain unknown. As archaeologist and anthropologist Charles Higham explains, “Curiously, there are no direct references to it in the epigraphic record, so we do not know its original name and controversy remains over its function and aspects of its symbolic status.”[1] Originally dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu, the complex was later converted to Buddhist use (the word “wat” typically refers to Buddhist monasteries[2]), and continues to be a site of religious pilgrimage today.This article was originally published on November 9, 2015.

King Suryavarman II began construction on Angkor Wat shortly after ascending to the throne in 1113. Royal succession in the Khmer empire was typically a violent affair, and Suryavarman's ascent was no exception. He killed his great-uncle in battle to seize the throne. However, inscriptions detailing Suryavarman’s rise to power describe him uniting two previously opposing factions, leading to a period of relative unity and stability.[3] He also continued the tradition of the previous kings, building Angkor Wat, a new royal temple complex, distinct from those of his predecessors.[4] Although the names of any architects or designers are lost to history, it is likely that Suryavarman’s chief priest and spiritual advisor Divakarapandita was highly influential in the temple’s construction.[5]King Suryavarman II began construction on Angkor Wat shortly after ascending to the throne in 1113.

Some archaeologists suggest that 90% of this area was originally occupied by a city surrounding the formal temple precinct, including the royal palace, all built of wood.[7] Today, all that remains are the temple buildings, constructed of sandstone and laterite, a type of local clay that hardens quickly when exposed to air and sun, used primarily for foundations and internal structures.[8]In contrast with many of the other temples at Angkor, Angkor Wat faces west, a reflection of its dedication to Vishnu, who rules over the western quadrant of the compass.[6] A wide rectangular moat surrounds the complex, and just inside the moat an outer wall defines an area approximately 1,500 meters east to west, and 1,300 meters north to south–the largest temple area in Angkor.

Two small stone buildings, known as “libraries,” flank the causeway near the midpoint. Despite their name, these buildings would have been shrines of some kind, not storage for manuscripts.[9]From the western gateway of the outer wall, a long causeway leads to the main temple precinct. Two small stone buildings, known as “libraries,” flank the causeway near the midpoint. Despite their name, these buildings would have been shrines of some kind, not storage for manuscripts.[9]The temple itself consists of two of the primary elements of Khmer architecture: the pyramid, and concentric galleries.[10] The pyramid takes the form of three stepped terraces, with each step bordered on all sides by covered galleries. At each level gateways in the galleries indicate the pathway to the central shrine, and towers punctuate the corners. The pyramid culminates in five towers–an indication of the temple's central shrine.The temple itself consists of two of the primary elements of Khmer architecture: the pyramid, and concentric galleries.[10] The pyramid takes the form of three stepped terraces, with each step bordered on all sides by covered galleries.

The pyramid culminates in five towers–an indication of the temple's central shrine.The entire complex symbolizes the Hindu beliefs enshrined within. As Freeman and Jacques describe, “It is, above all else, a microcosm of the Hindu universe. The moat represents the mythical oceans surrounding the earth and the succession of concentric galleries represent the mountain ranges that surround Mount Meru, the home of the gods. The towers represent the mountain’s peaks, and the experience of the ascent to the central shrine is, maybe intentionally, a fairly convincing imitation of climbing a real mountain.”[11] Historian Eleanor Mannikka’s research has also indicated that dimensions and building elements at Angkor Wat correspond to “calendrically and cosmologically significant totals.”[12]The entire complex symbolizes the Hindu beliefs enshrined within.

In total, Angkor Wat contains nearly 2,000 square meters (20,000 square feet) of bas-relief, in addition to the extensively carved lintels, friezes, and pediments, and the nearly 2,000 apsaras (celestial dancers who entertain the gods) carved throughout the complex.[13] The majority of the sculptures depict the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. The bas-reliefs at Angkor Wat also include a series on Suryavarman II, the first known depiction of a Angkorian king and his court.[14] In addition to the intricate carvings, remnants of paint, and even gold leaf indicate an even more dazzling appearance (although it is not known if these elements were original or added later).[15][16]To further emphasize the Hindu symbolism, the galleries are lined with bas-relief sculpture carved into the sandstone.

The temples at Angkor are often depicted as the ruins of a failed society, but in reality the rise of Theravada Buddhism led to the construction of wooden temples that have not survived, and as Freeman and Jacques put it, “The Khmers never forgot the existence of their monuments, and even if they neglected the majority of their temples, Angkor Wat always remained occupied and a place of worship.”[17]In the decades following Suryavarman II’s death, King Jayavarman VII brought Buddhism to Angkor, and converted many of the temples, including Angkor Wat, to Buddhist use.

The proposed extension to the Central University Library by EXHIBIT Architectura in Cluj Napoca, Romania is an exercise in the design of a contemporary civic, monumental structure among historic, and grandiose institutional buildings.

In a video by Studio Banana, Copenhagen-based BIG's founder Bjarke Ingels speaks to the firm’s design ethos and development. Known for their experimentation with bold and playful forms, the firm has produced some of the most recognizable works of the last decade including the 8 House complex in Denmark and Via 57 West in New York. In the video, Ingels points to communication as the key to success in the field, calling its power analogous to an artist's hammer and chisel. He also draws comparison to Darwinian concepts of evolution, noting that BIG's migration of ideas and iterative design development reflects a similar selection process. He applies this notion, along with another important principle to the firm--sustainability, to discuss works such as their Danish Pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai Design Expo that examines sustainability and experiential architecture.

Text description provided by the architects. What happens when the concept of a project is reduced to a façade in the process of its development? Are purely aesthetic aims valid in architecture? Is façadism something worthwhile? Are we to become architectural dermatologists?

A client contacted us to design a hotel for corporate suites in Nápoles, a residential neighborhood in Mexico City that has been rapidly converting to office use over the past few years. The plot was located across the street from the convention center of the World Trade Center, by far the busiest office building in the city. The suites were intended to accommodate businesspeople visiting the WTC and the year round expositions.

One of the biggest complaints of caffeine-charged traveling businesspeople is that no matter how hard they try to avoid it, their daily lives eventually turn into a boring and tedious routine: wake up at 5:30 am, take a cab to the airport, a Starbucks coffee while waiting at the gate, a tasteless omelet in the plane, a cab to the same forgettable hotel, meeting at 9am, business lunch, afternoon meetings, drinks, back to the hotel, sleep, wake up at 5:30am, catch the flight back… and so on. Their lives seem filled with sameness. 
Save this picture!
This motivated us to create a hotel where every recurring visit would be a completely different experience in an attempt to break their drudging routine. Every suite would have a different floor plan and spatial arrangement. The different shapes were then assembled like a giant Tetris to form a vertical tower. The tower culminates with the last shape left in a cantilever to generate suspense… The assembled shapes were then raised to provide an entrance to the building. To further accentuate the specific character of the suites, each shape was conceived of a different material: wood, metal, volcanic stone, marble, ceramic, limestone, glass… 
Save this picture!
When the construction of the building had begun, the client suddenly changed his mind and decided that from an operational point of view it was too complicated to have 15 different suites. He wanted only two types of suites, the single and the double height. We were shocked. 
Save this picture!
He encouraged us by letting us know his decision was bitter-sweet. The bitter part was losing the original concept and the sweet part was that we could maintain the façade because he really liked it. 
Save this picture!
We had to find a way to adapt the floor plans and reorganize the interiors without sacrificing the façade. In the end, the client got his hotel and we kept our façade.

KSEVT will have emphasized public significance and will generate social, cultural and scientific activities.In the KSEVT building that replaces the existing object of the multifunctional arts center there will be an abundance of social activities, with fixed and temporary exhibitions, conferences and club/study activities. The building will therefore be intended for the local population, as well as guests of exhibitions and participants of international symposia and conferences. In the club area at the top of the building researchers of the history of space technology will be able to focus on their work, removed from the activities in the lower part of the building. The building is a monolithic structure, freely positioned on the allotment between the main road on one side and the stream with a green hinterland on the other. The exterior and interior of the building are determined by two low cylinders. The bottom one is larger and rises from the North to the South, while the upper one is smaller and it joins with the larger one on the southern side and rises towards the North. The bottom cylinder is supported by the transparent surface of the entrance glazing. The spatial relationship between the two cylinders creates a dynamic effect, which is even more accentuated by full glass rings around the building.

The spatial relationship between the two cylinders creates a dynamic effect, which is even more accentuated by full glass rings around the building.The effect of floatation and rotation of the building on its southern and western side towards the road and the entrenchment into the surface on the other side towards the stream and hill creates an impression of memorable importance of the building in this area, as well as its connection to its immediate surroundings. The spatial effects give the building its most distinguishing feature – the effect of artificial gravity due to floatation and rotation. The building has two entrances – the main one to the central space from the square in front of the building on the southeastern side and the northern entrance from the gravelly surface above the stream. The main entrance covers the overhanging part of the larger cylinder. Through this “tight” space, past the circular vestibule with a reception, we enter the interior of the hall. The vestibule can be separated from the activities in the hall by a curtain. The entrance glazing can be completely opened and can connect the activities in the hall with the square. The circular hall for 300 people is surrounded on both sides by a semicircular ramp. This marks the beginning of the exhibition area, which continues from here to the interior of the overhanging part of the larger cylinder. On the west side, along the ramp, there are smaller office areas. Ascending on this ramp also represents a transition from the bright space of the hall to the dark exhibition area. The separated vertical connection with a staircase and a large elevator connects the exhibition area directly to the vestibule of the hall. The exhibition space continues through the landing between the elevator and the staircase to the smaller cylinder, the multi-purpose hall, an auditorium which is raised like a terrace above the hall. From here there is a vertical view of what is happening below. The smaller cylinder is concluded at the highest, northernmost part with the club area – the library, the most intimate part of the entire building.

Text description provided by the architects. In the small town of Ibaraki, 25km outside of Osaka, Japan, stands one of Tadao Ando’s signature architectural works, the Church of the Light.  The Church of the Light embraces Ando’s philosophical framework between nature and architecture through the way in which light can define and create new spatial perceptions equally, if not more so, as that of his concrete structures.  Completed in 1989, the Church of the Light was a renovation to an existing Christian compound in Ibaraki.  The new church was the first phase to a complete redesign of the site – later completed in 1999 – under Ando’s design aesthetic.

For Ando, the Church of Light is an architecture of duality – the dual nature of existence – solid/void, light/dark, stark/serene.  The coexisting differences leave the church void of any, and all, ornament creating a pure, unadorned space.  The intersection of light and solid raises the occupants awareness of the spiritual and secular within themselves.

The employment of simplistic materials reinforces the duality of the space; the concrete structure removes any distinction of traditional Christian motifs and aesthetic.  Besides an extruded cross from the east facing façade, the church is composed of a concrete shell; the concrete adds to the darkness of the church by creating a more humble, meditative place of worship. As a testament to minimalist architecture, the crosses void in the east facing wall is the only prominent religious symbol present in the church.

Formally, Ando’s Church of the Light is minimalist and reductive of religious paraphernalia to a simple cruciform extrusion, which is often criticized as disturbingly empty, void, and undefined.  Although it has been stated to be nothing more than six walls and a roof, there is a whole level of design aesthetic implemented by Ando and his contractors that is misread and unrecognized by the occupants.

As a modern, minimalist structure the Church of the Light emits an architectural purity that is found in the details.  The reinforced concrete volume is void of any and all ornament that is not part of the construction process.  The seams and joints of the concrete are built with precision and care by master Japanese carpenters, along with Ando, that have worked to create an immaculately smooth surface and accurately aligned joints.  So much so, that the seams of the concrete formwork align perfectly with the crosses extrusion on the east side of the church.

The concrete construction is a reinforcement of Ando’s principal focus on simplicity and minimalist aesthetic; however, the way in which the concrete is poured and formed gives the concrete a luminous quality when exposed to natural light.  Ando’s decision to place the cross on the east façade allows for light to pour into the space throughout the early morning and into the day, which has a dematerializing effect on the interior concrete walls transforming the dark volume into an illuminated box. Ando’s approach to light and concrete in the Church of the Light, as well as his other projects, has a surreal effect that perceptually changes material into immaterial, dark into light, light into space.

“In all my works, light is an important controlling factor.  I create enclosed spaces mainly by means of thick concrete walls.  The primary reason is to create a place for the individual, a zone for oneself within society. When the external factors of a city's environment require the wall to be without openings, the interior must be especially full and satisfying.” –Tadao Ando

The 13,000 hectare area south is Moscow is to be developed by the Masshtab company, led by Maxwan Architects of Rotterdam for the urban planning concept of the A101project.The Block City is a masterplan for the area to be built up. It envisions the introduction of standard sizes for urban blocks that can be interchangeable with flexibilities in their typologies and phasing at various stages of the project’s completion. The first phase of the project to be realized is 157 hectares with 12 million sqm of housing of the Block City area. The following proposals are winners for the design of the urban block.

More on the winning projects after the break.The first of the project by SVESMI and CIE, Six of a Kind, qualified for the low density category of Block City with 14,000 sqm of housing and a block size defined at 75 x 125 m. The proposal attempts to subdi-vide the block into smaller scaled objects. This strategy for low density housing creates a division be-tween urbanism and suburbanism, as though the apartments can be subdivide into individual villas within a vertical block. The scheme is composed of six small towers with a continuous band that demarcates the edge of the street from the interiority of the block. This approach provides privacy for the collective resi-dence of the six blocks and provides each building with solar access, views and private parking. Private gardens on the first level of each block open out into a central spine of a collective park for the entire block.

The heights of the towers are variable, depending on density requirements. Taller towers will be oriented to the north end of each block to maximize sunlight hours. Between each tower there are gaps that allow light and air to enter the block’s interior and provides small view corridors into and out of the block.

The composition is easily recognized as an urban unit that makes a clear distinction between private and public space. It follows scale of a five-storey standard Soviet layout with its traditional proportions improved and its apartments suited to contemporary lifestyles.

Truly sustainable construction projects do not solely focus on environmental performance, but also incorporate aspects of innovation, economic feasibility, architectural quality and above all social impact. These so-called five target issues serve as the basis for the adjudication process of the Holcim Awards competition for sustainable construction projects and visions. Naturally, each project has its own focus, but to be successful in the competition they have to perform well in all five target issues.Truly sustainable construction projects do not solely focus on environmental performance, but also incorporate aspects of innovation, economic feasibility, architectural quality and above all social impact.

This is demonstrated with the winner of the Holcim Awards Silver 2005 for Asia Pacific. The project focuses on an eight-legged concrete spider which proved to accelerate coral growth in degraded reefs. Destructive fishing practices, pollution and other damage together with climate change are severely impacting the coral reefs. Marine biodiversity and fish stocks have dwindled causing significant impacts not only on the oceans, but also on local communities who rely on fishing for food and economic development. The project designers found that concrete is an ideal material not only for making the framework strong and resistant to the elements, but also due to its low acidity which favors accelerated coral growth. The young corals can therefore be soon harvested and successfully transplanted to other areas.

Income from tourism supports fishing families and generated additional economic activity and the local community, who were initially skeptical about the coral reef rehabilitation project are now convinced that there is income in environmental restoration and conservation. With this experience, environmentalists and other lobby groups would have better chances of disseminating environmental restoration and protection techniques to other communities e.g. the concept of implementing Marine Protected Areas (MPA’s) which is often acceptable to coastal townspeople of the country.

The original use of the building included a large vehicular elevator accessing all floors for the installation of automobile windshields and glass. This large vertical shaft yielded an extremely inefficient existing floor plate, while 50% of the existing square footage occurred below the street level. 
Save this picture!
The design of the project rectifies these inefficiencies by locating a new vertical circulation core within an addition directly adjacent to the existing building along with much needed occupiable square footage within a new penthouse level. This new circulation core allows for the reclamation of the floor area previously occupied by the existing elevator and gives it over the new residential and retail spaces. 
Save this picture!
These additions are separated both in plan and in section with a ribbon of glass and framed within a folded plane providing a clear distinction of the new program while celebrating the existing building’s historic qualities. A total of 15 unique residential units were created within a much more efficient floor plate utilizing new modern finishes to again contrast and showcase the existing massive existing structural elements of the original building.

The four retail spaces have direct access from the main public pedestrian path, providing much needed activity to the district. Private parking under the building and newly created outdoor space for the residents gives this urban mixed use development much of the conveniences rarely found in a center city development.

This large vertical shaft yielded an extremely inefficient existing floor plate, while 50% of the existing square footage occurred below the street level. The original use of the building included a large vehicular elevator accessing all floors for the installation of automobile windshields and glass. This large vertical shaft yielded an extremely inefficient existing floor plate, while 50% of the existing square footage occurred below the street level.The design of the project rectifies these inefficiencies by locating a new vertical circulation core within an addition directly adjacent to the existing building along with much needed occupiable square footage within a new penthouse level. This new circulation core allows for the reclamation of the floor area previously occupied by the existing elevator and gives it over the new residential and retail spaces.

A total of 15 unique residential units were created within a much more efficient floor plate utilizing new modern finishes to again contrast and showcase the existing massive existing structural elements of the original building.

Text description provided by the architects. Located on the north lawn of the United Nations campus, in New York City, the UN Interim Canopy is a Porte Cochere, designed by FTL Design Engineering Studio. The structure sits adjacent to the UN’s new temporary General Assembly building, designed by HLW International. The design serves as an entrance pavilion and security screen for the general assembly delegates. The structure is envisioned as a relocatable building which is intended to be moved to another part of the campus at the completion of the renovation. Follow the break for more photographs and drawings of United Nations Porte Cochere.

Joe Schedlbauer, Amedeo Perlas: The design explores lightness as a visual, physical and sustainable approach, using a minimum of materials to reduce its environmental impact. FTL seeks to build responsive structures that contain spaces which inspire, where building, nature and people can meet. Drawing its inspiration from the surrounding landscape the canopy is nested within the campus landscape utilizing the contours of site as a visual buffer. Helical arches undulate and twist along the length of the roadway gently peeling away from the main building.

The renovation of the historic UN buildings is scheduled as a five year project. Due to the temporary nature of the interim buildings the environmental impact and sustainability of the Porte Cochere was a prime interest for the UN and was considered at outset of the design process. Realizing these concerns FTL introduced the concept of relocatablity. Why recycle parts when you can recycle an entire structure?

Steel and Cable Schedules
The Porte Cochere may be relocated to another location on the UN campus or to any other site of the UN’s choosing. With this as a starting point, the design developed to have minimal anchorage points and to be modular in nature, using prefabricated steel trusses allowing for quick installation which minimizes the impact of construction crews on site. The high-tech textile membrane’s function is two fold; it provides support as a working tensile element equally distributing structural loads and defuses sunlight to naturally illuminate the space below. The structure uses two fabrics, a Teflon coated glass fabric as the main fabric and a silicone coated glass fabric for greater translucency in the arches. Functionally the canopy provides shelter for the motorcades as they load and unload delegates, requiring ventilation for the idling cars inside. The open facades and linear vents that run the entire length of the trusses allow fresh air to flow freely throughout the enclosure.

The Porte Cochere offers an elegant counter point to the rectilinear architectural elements which inhabit the site. This temporary addition to the long history of the site is at once an suggestion of ideas that speak not only of the present but look forward to the future possibilities of the United Nations, it’s mission and what humanity may achieve.

New Harmony Grotto, by METALAB Architecture + Fabrication, is a reinterpretation of avant garde architect Frederick Kielser’s Grotto for Meditation. With the growing genre of architecture generated by biomorphic design and biomimetic processes, a reevaluation of Kiesler’s work is ever more timely. During the mid-20th century he became increasingly occupied with the relationship of structure and natural form in architecture. The Cave of the New Being (also known as the Grotto for Meditation), proposed in the 1960s for New Harmony, Indiana, represented the designer’s pièce de résistance, embodying all of the intellectual currents of his era, from surrealism to biotechnics, yet it was never realized.New Harmony Grotto, by METALAB Architecture + Fabrication, is a reinterpretation of avant garde architect Frederick Kielser’s Grotto for Meditation.

Hines College of Architecture and thanks to the patronage of Mrs. Jane Blaffer Owen, Kiesler’s original client, professors Andrew Vrana, Joe Meppelink, Ben Nicholson, together with undergraduate students, all embarked on formal research and tectonic fulfillment of the project, utilizing digital modeling and fabrication technologies. The participants complemented research with the help of archival resources, accessed via the Blaffer and the Kiesler Foundations. More than providing closure on an unfinished project, the New Harmony Grotto will function as a permanent landmark on the UH university campus, as part of a meditation pond next to the Philip Johnson designed College of Architecture.

With the aid of three-dimensional scanning, reverse engineering and digital fabrication, the team spawned a structural/spatial apparatus that pays tribute to Kiesler’s intended maritime-inspired forms and tiled patterning parametrically designed into a minimal surface.

With a double ulterior motive, assure the views to the mountains and provide the living areas contact with the interior outdoors, a 10m cube is placed 10m behind the street limit, inducing the division of the plot on four frames of 5m X 10m; fragmentation that permits to incorporate the garden as the void that articulates the relationship between the volume of the house and the frontal access/garage volume.

At first floor level, in axis with the main access, and 15m with the exterior limit, a change of material announces the access to the private area: a pass way that embraces the lineal ascend towards the bedrooms’ hall, from where you discover a higher space, a 25 feet high open space that allows a ray of light that traces time by the sun path moving through the walls that confine the tower. This void receives a staircase that sets out a continuous ascend towards the family room and the master bedroom.

The character that the house transmits to the exterior is given by the sobriety of its 4 planes, which are distinguished by its change in height and the arrangement of its openings given by the relationship that each bedroom establishes with the exterior; searching for a view and an specific light-shadow effect to complete the tacit sense of inhabitance.

Text description provided by the architects. The assignment consisted in a house for a young marriage with two children, located on a 950 square meter situated in La Reserva lots in Chicureo, Colina, Chile.

The terrain presented three conditions that determined the actions taken that would finally define the project. Because of the lot being of triangular shape located in a corner, the legal edification lines left the constructible area in the center, a steep incline of 40%, and finally, sun exposure and views towards the valley.

The operation consists in separating the architecture program into two overlapping volumes parallel to the terrain lines, so when seen in section both volumes relate to the landscape. The lower volume is buried in the terrain and adopts a materiality that allows you to understand it as a socle that blends with the landscape as well as the stone walls that enclose the site. In this volume the bedrooms connect with the garden that exists over the street level below. 
Save this picture!
The upper volume lies over it, by abstraction it differs from the stone socle and the terrain. In order to do this, we worked with simple geometry dressed in one only material with industrial shaping and a neutral color (gray stone). The volume breaks to prevent views towards the quarry orienting them to the valley.

This volume contains the public space and connects through the only opening to the garden located at the upper street level.
