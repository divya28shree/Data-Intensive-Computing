source another past 200 year Italian physicist Cesare Marchetti colleague discovered hard truth It take almost century new source primary energy — coal petroleum natural gas nuclear power — command half world market Just grow 10 percent 1 percent take almost 50 yearsYou would expect supplier switch quickly better abundant cheaper cleaner source But infrastructure ha catch In America natural gas needed longdistance pipeline go national electric car need stillscarce charging station People adapt Elizabethan preacher condemned coal literally Devil’s excrement Victorian homeowner comfortable gaslight thought Edison’s light bulb bright Competition heavily invested older source ha overcome fossil fuel today These change take timeToday global temperature rising time running short That’s starting point Joshua Goldstein Staffan Qvist’s smart new study move away fossil fuel A double burden compound problem We limit increase greenhouse gas production 2018 Paris Agreement specifies But isn’t enough“Decarbonization” author write “requires replacing existing fossil fuel meeting new demand carbonfree sources” That second challenge ha hardly yet addressed It must especially given increasing prosperity developing region — China India Africa — author correctly say “want energy” “have moral right it” As consequence worldwide energy consumption 30 year projected 50 percent higher today If number sound exaggerated think four billion Asians installing airconditioningFor Goldstein emeritus professor international relation Qvist Swedish engineer possible solution double dilemma rapid worldwide expansion nuclear power No source collection source energy argue positioned meet challenge time Without growth nuclear power replacing fossil fuel renewables simply decarbonizes existing supply It doesn’t deal increased demand coming developing worldOne country “solved climate change” book’s subtitle ha Sweden Qvist’s homeland Much France Sweden achieved expanding electrical supply nuclear power rather fossil fuel Its concern time 1970s wasn’t global warming reliability Further hydropower development wa environmentally undesirable oil crisis decade made petroleum unpredictable sourceBetween 1970 1990 Sweden built dozen nuclear power plant four site eight continue operate today They supply 40 percent Sweden’s electricity equal hydropower Wind biofuels supply rest As result electricity Sweden cheap clean reliable Serendipitously author point “Sweden became successful country history expanding lowcarbon electricity generation leading way addressing climate change”Goldstein Qvist contrast Sweden’s experience Germany’s That country decided switch renewables mostly wind solar eliminating nuclear power By doubling renewables cutting nuclear “it substituted one carbonfree source another CO2 emission really decrease all” Today 40 percent Germany’s energy come dirty brown coal six Europe’s 10 polluting power plant GermanAfter initial view two contrasting European program “A Bright Future” largely devoted debunking many attack nuclear power ha weathered year “The antinuclear movement ha progressed reason oppose nuclear power” author write “one another” It wa dangerous Then would lead weapon proliferation Then wa uneconomical argument still made one author debunk come country like Sweden South Korea haven’t experienced strangulating effect heavy government regulation antinuclear litigationThen wa unnecessary wa argued renewables could job “But every case nuclear power wa shut renewables filled gap CO2 emission gone whereas place Ontario expanded nuclear power emission went down”A final claim nuclear power politically infeasible “is selffulfilling prophecy quick write practical solution humanity’s serious problem … Politics way catching necessity”I happen sympathy authors’ view nuclear power must major part worldwide campaign limit reverse global warming Their discussion omits important historical component however one ha subverted logical argumentHistorically antinuclear movement didn’t emerge environmental concern argument nuclear’s environmental advantage often fall deaf ear The movement originated panic among European American intellectual 1950s ’60s overpopulation expressed luridly popular book entomologist Paul Ehrlich’s 1969 “The Population Bomb” They believed power plant would exacerbate human density urban growth But nuclear power champion like Alvin Weinberg longtime director America’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory countered nuclear could supply energy enough forestall social collapse neoMalthusians feared In end green revolution demographic transition followed thirdworld economic development met food need limited population growth predicted level 10 billion 2100 But nuclear power wa anathema Democratic Party American European Greens tragic misalignment liberal valuesThe tide may turning Politics may catch necessity But “Green New Deal” recently championed Congress includes even existing nuclear power production grudgingly promotes notion “A Bright Future” dispute — 100 percent renewables save day Nuclear ha stalled America Western Europe largely political reason partly boom fracked natural gas Natural gas release fully half much CO2 coal But except manufacture construction material fuel nuclear release none Momentum ha shifted China Russia building advanced reactor domestic use well sale Asia Europe Middle East Both however increasing nuclear power production home order sell fossil fuel abroad little net gain global warming Whether opposition converge time spare

CHARGED The New Movement Transform American Prosecution End Mass Incarceration By Emily BazelonIf aspired high office 20th early 21st century wa sound advice Get thee prosecutor’s office Politicians party Democrats like John Kerry Republicans like Rudolph Giuliani parlayed prosecutorial perch political power nationwide fameThe basic recipe using prosecutor’s post springboard politics required “tough crime” protecting public putting criminal behind bar The vast majority state local prosecutor United States elected taking punitive tack wa generally considered path reelection — frequently election higher office Prosecutors strong incentive harsh rather lenient merciful dealing defendant incentive helped shape criminal justice system know today In word law professor historian Jed Shugerman scholar prosecutor turned politician “The emergence prosecutor’s office steppingstone higher office” ha “dramatic consequence American criminal law mass incarceration”These consequence full

bear much responsibility overincarceration conviction innocent serious problem criminal justice system“We often think prosecutor defense lawyer point triangle plane judge poised equal contest level playing field neutral arbiter” Bazelon writes But misconception As Brooklyn district attorney Eric Gonzalez put “It’s discretion Do authorize arrest request bail argue keep jail let go charge take plea bargain Prosecutors decide especially get second chance”To show prosecutorial power operates real world Bazelon follows two young defendant system Kevin pseudonym 20yearold Brownsville

acknowledging necessary role system proprosecutor ruling Supreme Court analyzes almost entirely publicpolicy perspective little focus legal reasoning This could cause reader share Bazelon’s politics dismiss core argument But extent it’s polemic “Charged” reflects author’s passion subject “As journalist” writes “I’ve never felt greater sense urgency exposing root problem shining light people

FALTER Has Human Game Begun Play Itself Out By Bill McKibben“Falter” environmentalist Bill McKibben’s latest book threat planet combine fear bad outcome hope good outcome His opening page set stage “This volume bleak” writes elaborating paragraph later “I think we’re uniquely ill prepared cope emerging challenge So far we’re coping Still one sense I le grim younger day This book end conviction resistance danger least possible”McKibben’s worst fear summarized subtitle “Has Human Game Begun Play Itself Out” In first half book explains present danger civilization include risk nuclear war multiple hazard associated climate change increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide threat food production rising sea level ocean warming acidification While danger widely discussed McKibben provides fresh perspective surprising example engaging writing style What could familiar cheap simple asphalt roof tile But McKibben explains manufacture distribution depend multiple big system — undersea desert oil drilling limestone sand mining fiberglass fabrication pipeline refinery rail line truck route building supply store etc — increasing risk scale complexity susceptibility disruptionThe middle part book discus force opposing solution problem laid first part — motivated variously selfinterest grim reality power ideal view proper role government These force include Exxon poverty inequality Ayn Rand Koch brother rich Americans President Trump Silicon Valley This book wa one anticipated title April See full listSome people hope world problem solved advanced new technology especially artificial intelligence genetic engineering along device geared expanding life span allowing u colonize space Considering technology turn McKibben explains skepticism hopedfor benefit concern potential undesirable side effectsFinally book’s last section McKibben offer reason hope Foremost among solar panel making cheap renewable energy available around world nonviolent movement whose successful practitioner entrenched wellarmed opposition included Gandhi Martin Luther King Jr Earth Day demonstrator McKibben’s group 350orgI share McKibben’s view environmental problem The practical question face ha tactic How strike balance fear hope adjust tactic best reach diverse target audienceAs Yogi Berra noted it’s tough make prediction especially future It depends measurable present trend also unforeseeable decision Five year ago I would never predicted public’s nowwidespread recognition climate change human cause view yet shared enough politiciansMcKibben’s book much ground fear take 18 chapter ground hope take five Fear motivate people currently undecided increase motivation others already convinced But experience people need strong dose hope spurred action Why waste effort hopeless cause One group ha learned lesson cancer lobby succeeds raising fund research stressing cure may around corner grim statistic disease’s ongoing tollIn fact reason hope besides McKibben discus One change policy powerful multinational corporation I already hear horrified scream many environmentalist friend I say However I’ve board two effective international environmental organization World Wildlife Fund Conservation International heavily involved big powerful corporation I acknowledge corporation bad thing But also good thing large scale power make uniquely capable For example Walmart ha quietly making effort manage supply chain waste truck fleet sustainably — partly partly discovered save money soYou may already closed ear bad thing know even best big company also Listen extraterrestrial visitor Andromeda Galaxy company android either purely good purely bad Alas Planet Earth good bad mixed together don’t company purely good If environmentalist refuse engage big company order push good thing fewer bad one could well end McKibben’s worstcase scenario human extinctionAnother reason I feel hopeful ha success many recent supranational agreement — bilateral agreement nation regional agreement world agreement Those agreement addressed difficult issue required negotiation nation hate fight But agreement nevertheless succeeded eliminating rinderpest smallpox delineating nearshore economic zone ocean reducing chlorofluorocarbon damage ozone layer setting standard oil tanker pollution establishing framework seabed mining shared royalty Those success give hope may similarly resolve difficult international problem including climate changeMy concern tactic ha diverse audience environmentalist like McKibben must address book It’s enough u write already sympathetic convinced We also write skeptical hostile If give many rich powerful smart people skeptical environmental threat doomed McKibben’s worstcase scenarioTo convince skeptic requires different approach work reinforce conviction someone already converted I witnessed recently I wa environmentalist friend We ran another friend mine rich powerful smart — politically conservative I introduced two friend My conservative friend asked environmentalist friend answered “I run UCLA’s sustainability program” My conservative friend replied “What’s that” skepticism evident voiceMy environmentalist friend responded way conservative friend could understand “That mean running thing child grandchild living rich thriving world” She went describe UCLA combining heating cooling power plant reduced greenhouse gas emission saved money The skepticism disappeared friend’s voice wa ready hear moreIt take many different voice persuade world’s diverse citizen corporation collaborate solving world’s biggest problem McKibben’s voice ha influential one My hope new book strengthen motivation already sympathetic view My fear won’t convince many remain hostile I hope first

FIREFIGHTING The Financial Crisis Its Lessons By Ben S Bernanke Timothy F Geithner Henry M Paulson JrFor month 2008 2009 many people feared world economy wa verge collapse They good reason afraid Financial market virtually frozen credit almost unavailable anyone except safest borrower The real economy wa free fall Over winter America wa losing 700000 job month world trade industrial output falling fast first year Great DepressionIn end however worst didn’t happen The financial crisis caused huge lasting damage But bottom didn’t fall completelyWhat saved u There multiple factor But one element wa key public official didn’t stand aside world burned Instead acted — always soon enough always forcefully enough always wisely pretty effectively same“Firefighting” brief account crucial moment three important actor Ben S Bernanke wa chairman Federal Reserve Board influential economic position world Henry M Paulson Jr wa George W Bush’s Treasury secretary Timothy F Geithner wa

juicy tellall could exercise boasting author saved world could litany excuse explaining none went wrong wa authors’ fault And truth there’s little bit element — much consideringWhat Bernanke et al — I’m going call BGP short — given u instead primer crisis wa possible even almost nobody saw coming ticktock crisis financial rescue unfolded scary warning futureMuch BGP say familiar economist perhaps le general public Fundamentally argue happened 2008 wa “classic financial panic” kind ha happened ever since dawn modern banking Even Adam Smith called financial regulation seen banking crisis firsthandSo didn’t people see coming Part wa hubris “Serious economist arguing financial innovation like derivative … made crisis thing past” How serious economist actually And reality wa financial innovation made thing worse better Most “the leverage US finance” — debt wa vulnerable panic — moved “shadow banks” unlike conventional bank largely unregulated lacked financial safety netAlso say “it’s hard fix something breaks” As long housing bubble wa still inflating default everything seemed sound A Cassandras warned risk like original Cassandra went unheeded And BGP credit acknowledge failure recognize danger including Bernanke’s notorious declaration problem subprime lending “contained”Then fell apart Most book concerned increasingly desperate effort BGP official prop financial domino could topple collapse whole system It’s intricate story one whose detail probably seem lot interesting involved broader readership And I don’t think shocking new revelationsThere however unifying theme complexity Containing crisis wa hard precisely financial innovation Conventional bank overseen guaranteed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ha power “to wind insolvent bank orderly fashion standing behind obligations” But “the federal government orderly resolution regime nonbanks”So BGP company engage frantic innovation For example Fed funneled money conventional bank hand nonbanks effect lending institution weren’t really supposed support This exposed Fed new risk Paulson effectively indemnified Fed risk apparently without real legal authority At another point run moneymarket fund — would complete catastrophe — seemed imminent Paulson guaranteed fund using money legally earmarked completely different purpose defending dollar’s foreign exchange valueSometimes effort fell short In section doubt cause lot controversy BGP argue wa nothing could legally done prevent bankruptcy Lehman Brothers event nearly broke world Was true I’m enough lawyer tellStill late spring 2009 storm seemed passed Recovery wa slow point back economy low unemployment seemingly stable financial marketsBut worried another crisisYes author say final chapter downright scaryBanking argue actually le risky wa thanks financial reform far short done nonetheless led safer practice But crisis still happen firefighting ability policymakers gravely compromised Interest rate low cutting much good Fiscal stimulus BGP agree wa crucial much harder sell given high level debt And Congress ha taken away much authority made extraordinary measure possible crisis In word it’s hard imagine BGP’s modern successor carrying kind rescue operation author managed decade agoAnd it’s even clear whether would try rate idea they’re The author nice say today’s top economic official seem systematically drawn rank got everything wrong crisis The failure Bear Stearns wa first solid indication much trouble Donald Trump ha chosen David Malpass Bear’s chief economist time head World Bank Larry Kudlow administration’s top economist ridiculed “bubbleheads” claimed housing price whack praised Paulson refusing bail Lehman — hour financial market went full meltdownIn word seem learned

presented inviting opportunity vent wrathThe handful official shaped policy 911 writes Mazarr political scientist currently RAND “not evil pernicious human beings” Instead Mazarr credit acting response “moralistic sense right thing” Viewed perspective “the Iraq war decision wa grounded sacred values” even evil pernicious consequence decision continue mountSo Mazarr bat away call “erroneous mythologies” attributing war neoconservative conspiracy describing plot protect Israel seize Arab oil He find explanation unworthy The invasion Iraq insists stemmed “America’s essential sense itself” “fundamentally messianic missionary character”As account war’s origin “Leap Faith” offer genuine revelation It clarifies confirms fill detail So Mazarr tell u within 24 hour 911 even Bush unveiled phrase “global war terrorism” decision overthrow Saddam “had essentially sealed cognitive amber” All remained wa work detail conjuring moral rationale would conceal absence strategic one The dearth hard evidence connecting Saddam Hussein Al Qaeda confirming existence Iraqi program developing weapon mass destruction wa beside point The administration declared Saddam threat nothing wa

grand idea bothersome trivia execution” Condoleezza Rice national security adviser wa given associate called “magical thinking” never gained respect Cheney Rumsfeld All according Mazarr “truly astonishing degree wishful thinking” permeated upper echelon government It wa like court Czar Nicholas II 1917So United States military commander focused problem getting Baghdad question wa happen next became orphan ignored unwanted Rumsfeld particular nursed fantasy United States could “be liberator hegemon time” — freeing Iraqis oppression quickly converting Iraq compliant ally would Washington’s bidding minimal mus fuss As result disorder triggered Saddam’s overthrow combined civil war insurgency ensued caught war’s architect completely surprise For next several year American soldier Iraqi civilian pay heavy price described malpractice Trumpian scaleTo explain term misplaced messianic impulse — selfdescribed indispensable nation bad run luck — may play well Washington serious introspection rarely welcome Yet ultimately explanation amount little dodge After altruism rarely ever provides adequate explanation action great power Exempting United States proposition Mazarr doe entail spectacular leap faithThe United States invaded Iraq response “vigorous missionary impulse” avoid reckoning fact Decades wrongheaded policy Middle East culminated 911 cataclysmic

THE EMPIRE AND THE FIVE KINGS America’s Abdication Fate World By BernardHenri Lévy GULLIBLE SUPERPOWER US Support Bogus Foreign Democratic Movements By Ted Galen CarpenterThe American foreign policy establishment two year prolonged existential crisis It watching president spurn expertise attack institution ridicule cherished assumption It get much blame quartercentury flailing hegemony one characterized depending ask much foreign intervention Kosovo Iraq Libya little Rwanda Syria Iran In introspective moment asks whether anything say doe matter allBut turmoil torment establishment fact converging around stronger consensus ha held since Cold War After era uncontested American dominance thinking go entered new era rivalry Or Trump administration’s National Security Strategy put “After dismissed phenomenon earlier century great power competition returned” Different camp thinker define cause contour rivalry different way They may see biggest challenge Beijing Moscow Tehran somewhere else But basic point ha become uncontroversialWhat contentious matter Should United States step fight interest value hunker restrain ambition Should defend fellow democracy reassure ally cede authority power even mean outcome might like Should muster resolve accept necessity lessTwo new book stake position opposite pole debate In “The Empire Five Kings” French philosopher BernardHenri Lévy — “committed intellectual” description — proclaims United States moment doubt retreat must take stand freedom “Do give discouragement” exhorts man usually referred BHL “Do become resigned” In “Gullible Superpower” Ted Galen Carpenter scholar libertarian Cato Institute counter nearly every American attempt take seemingly heroic stand founder messy foreign reality The better course “return earlier prudent realistic sensible policy tradition”In 1990s apex American dominance one Lévy’s compatriot dubbed United States “hyperpower” It wa said sneeringly Lévy embrace The United States “is empire recalcitrant one whose nobility ha always balk imperialism” His celebration American empire soaring sincere — “the second home every free person planet” — often incomprehensible laced namedropping digression circuitous analogy mixed metaphorsUnderneath breezy Gallic grandiosity Lévy delivers fairly ordinary analysis The United States kept semblance decent order around globe decade ha given “noblest vocation” combination toxic politics technology “Trump Zuckerberg though probably agree nothing two blade pair scissors” destroying democracy home leadership abroad Into “great vacuum left evaporation empire” stepped Lévy’s “five kings” — China Russia Iran Turkey Saudi Arabia together Sunni alliesLévy make ardent mostly persuasive case dominance resurgent power would mean world “A friend freedom” decree “must pray empire” And doomsaying see basic weakness challenger enough American resolve stop “implementing grandiose dreams” But call action seems demand United States confront five urgency time Most problematically five king include every Middle Eastern power center taking simultaneously unlikely turn well anyone except perhaps hardliner Moscow Beijing would look resulting American quagmire baffled surprise good fortuneLévy begin end book story Kurds joined United States ally fight ISIS never got backing hoped support independence Despite effort rally American European policymakers Kurds’ “sister democracy … uttered word Kurdish house Kirkuk gassed ransacked woman raped people tortured” In recounting tragedy Lévy reflects last time made player cause effort 2011 persuade United States Europe intervene Libya That action stopped possible massacre Benghazi helped bring murderous Muammar elQaddafi’s downfall also stoked bloody civil war continues today Lévy le interested weighing consequence celebrating purity intent nobility cause heroism standThat Carpenter exactly American foreign policy ha gone wrong Since 1980s tell United States ha repeatedly fallen charm offensive foreign actor — insurgent group protest movement dissident — con Washington reckless action What Lévy see virtuous hegemon Carpenter see naïve hapless superpower playing sucker “foreign faction … adept exploiting Americans’ sincere desire spread enlightened liberal capitalist ideals”Carpenter marshal example cringeinducing example American politician commentator hailing unsavory foreign movement “moral equal founding fathers” — Ronald Reagan said Nicaraguan contra army led largely officer loyal fallen dictator In various Cold War proxy battle Iraq war debate Syria Libya intervention — prediction peaceful democratic future yielded dismal resultsYet focusing gauzy myth tend dominate speech newspaper column Carpenter evades harder question coldblooded calculation lie behind He also ha fondness overstatement overreliance sketchy evidence lambastes others As often highflown rhetoric deployed service foreign policy goal American leader may led talk democracy human right even secondary mere cover le idealistic consideration Indeed Carpenter concedes several case “strategic rationale” action existed even exalted language used sell could withstand scrutiny For dissimilarity Lévy Carpenter share unstated conviction run American debate foreign policy good thing come together Like Lévy want every moral cause also strategically smart like Carpenter want believe choice made prudential ground won’t involve cost ideal value hold dear We want always well good good well Unfortunately foreign policy rare circumstance good thing actually come together — even le time contested power time primacy The tradeoff come wrenching inescapableIn early day Cold War — last time American foreign policy establishment converged around broad objective — one influential “committed intellectuals” use Lévy’s term wa theologian Reinhold Niebuhr Niebuhr wa famous Serenity Prayer “Grant serenity accept thing I cannot change courage change thing I wisdom know

“Black Hawk Down” returned often subject police work including provocative 2003 piece The Atlantic problematic gray area coercion torture When 2013 detective Maryland started question first solid

Welch wa 18 Lyon sister vanished He mall day day later told police he’d seen another man talking girl When year later coldcase detective learned crime Welch committed intervening decade — including child molestation — could help wondering le witness suspect But visit Welch prison hoping early release get jump saying know exactly they’re learn later found And much questioning Welch seems almost drunk power — “like fairytale goblin guarding treasure speaking riddles” The challenge facing detective “How get compulsive liar one every reason lie tell truth”In “The Last Stone” Bowden focus 21 month questioning revolving cast detective telling stirring suspenseful thoughtful story miraculously neither oversimplifies detail get lost thicket fourdecade case file This catandmouse tale told beautifully But like great true crime “The Last Stone” find power leaning cliché resisting — pushing something realistic evocative deeper truth In case Bowden show even exquisitely pulledoff interrogation messy business exhaustive strategizing followed gametime gut decision endless secondguessing soulsearchingAn interrogator’s important job — like journalist’s — keep subject talking “The problem wa convince wa best interest reveal knew” Bowden writes “even though manifestly wa not” Dave Davis detective spends time room Welch ha softest touch “Criminals saw man badge” Bowden writes Davis us empathy tactic even empathetic around Welch “meant donning moral blinders” As another detective nurturing style Katie Leggett put “We endure ‘friendship’ go crap get many answer could” Readers probably recognize triedandtrue strategy good copbad cop When Leggett loses temper Welch still another detective step smooth thing saying “I actually think still nice person thought were” Read review Bowden’s “Black Hawk Down A Story Modern War” Their interrogation target Bowden’s telling audacious foil mention colossal narcissist — “natively bright deeply ignorant cocky beyond reason” Welch seems driven keep tab police know So rather shut entirely play riskier game admitting enough keep coming back much could charged another crime His capacity lie bottomless lie rather ingeniously “built around known facts” Each time new information contradicts Welch alters story enough make sense new set fact reset cone slalom course glide ski “The ease Lloyd made shift never ceased amaze” Bowden writes “He acted never told story differently”Bowden good showing side protracted interrogation lying Deceit trickery tool trade police least American interrogation But perilous tool “Once get really interesting stuff” Bowden writes “you descend necessity moral ladder onto slippery ground” At worst forcing narrative onto suspect lead false confession example wrongly convicted men Central Park Five case attest And time weird area book evidence people say decade later persuasiveness evidence depends entirely whether people say believed The Welch talk detective wonder everything saying simply catering bias Hours tall tale “then five minute halftruth” Bowden writes “Were detective zeroing truth wa Lloyd desperately inventing”This selfdoubt — perpetual selfscrutiny — separate detective say one Netflix’s “Making Murderer” video spoonfeeds confession poor Brendan Dassey teenage boy intimidated gurgle back wa said Dassey’s conviction wa eventually tossed reinstated appeal federal Seventh Circuit The best interrogator Bowden explains “are connoisseur untruth” Again Bowden reporter feel kinship They must assemble cogent narrative morass chaos “What call history” Bowden writes best “artful informed honest speculation” The detective end writing story Hopefully true oneThe investigate Welch’s claim woollier story get The thing odious Welch might family venal abusive incestuous clan form book’s gothic subplot In end even skilled liar like Welch can’t keep story straight “Making rattled weary” Bowden writes “became strategy” A slip tongue help cop pry new admission Lyon family ha beginning answer Right end Welch’s concern “I can’t believe you’re me” say — mention two girl whose life destroyed long ago“Lloyd’s clumsy mendacity kept thing alive” Bowden writes That dedication inquisitor ready make Welch think best — trust like “You’re cop you’re good guy” Welch tell Davis one last encounter “You good heart” For interrogator may higher compliment

THE WAR BEFORE THE WAR Fugitive Slaves Struggle America’s Soul From Revolution Civil War By Andrew Delbanco Illustrated 453 pp Penguin Press 30The Civil War began one basic issue Was slavery ownership human legitimate national institution fixed national law United States Constitution One half country said wa said wa The ensuing conflict wa chief instigator Southern secession secessionist proclaimed It wa thus chief source war led slavery’s abolition United StatesThe struggle property slave focused largely fate Western territory also inflamed conflict status fugitive slave Proslavery Southerners insisted federal government wa obliged capture slave escaped free state return master thus vindicate masters’ absolute property right human Antislavery Northerners denying obligation supposed right saw fugitive heroic refugee bondage resisted federal interference fiercely sometimes violently Even fight territory Andrew Delbanco asserts “The War Before War” “dispute fugitive slave … launched final acceleration sectional estrangement”Delbanco eminent prolific scholar American literature well suited recounting history fugitive slave subject American fiction Harriet Beecher Stowe Toni

sometimes cursory always pleasing thing say fugitive slave Delbanco’s incisive analysis observation — important failure observe — form one book’s running themesDelbanco’s skill literary critic also illuminate contribution fugitive slave made growing antislavery movement Although number fugitive wa relatively small — according 1850 survey 1000 per year reached North — disproportionally aggravated sectional divide In part Delbanco argues runaway continuing symbolic insult slaveholders’ honor flight contradicted Southern claim slavery wa benevolent paternalist institution He might added fugitive slave issue became effective distracting wedge proslavery extremist deployed appeal conservative Northerners provoking antislavery radical violent paroxysm playing victim More important score fugitive slave either wrote dictated personal experience widely read narrative famously “Narrative Life Frederick Douglass American Slave” awakened Northern white enormity Southern slaveryTo credit Delbanco

others least partial exception But denying sensation caused amid political emergency 1840s 1850s “giving voice people long silenced” assailing proslavery propaganda sustained Northern white complacencyDelbanco’s literary judgment aside “The War Before War” mainly straightforward account event although familiar professional historian ought known anyone claim know anything American history In 1787 Southern delegate federal Constitutional Convention obtained fugitive slave clause called albeit vaguely capture return successful runaway Over following six decade persistent slave escape

socalled personal liberty law shield fugitivesIn 1850 responding slaveholders’ outcry Congress passed Fugitive Slave Act strengthened federal mandate arresting returning escapee In series shocking confrontation antislavery Northerners intervened either prevent capture fugitive liberate already custody The uproar pitched battle — Delbanco’s war war — helped turn Northern moderate abolitionist temperate Southerners fireeaters height 1854 prompted President Franklin Pierce order 1500 federal troop escort single fugitive Boston named Anthony Burns back slavery Virginia Enforcing fugitive slave law put federal government emphatically side slavery freedom hastened collapse national political system rise antislavery Republican Party coming warDelbanco aim balance antislavery allegiance caution smugness come historical hindsight In earlier writing wariness ha led taste little charitable revisionist interpretation present Civil War product political failure catastrophe instigated malcontent responsible national leadership could prevented This view ha arisen admixture pacifism insistence diminishing moral well political disaster slavery ha sometimes led advocate demonize abolitionist chief fomenter unnecessary war As Delbanco admires abolitionist slight slavery’s terror occasional revisionist musing seem stem horror military slaughterhouse wonder whether could avoided wariness sanctimony including Yankee sanctimonyIn book though Delbanco stick viewing war ghastly necessary price abolishing slavery — Abraham Lincoln described Second Inaugural Address cruel justice meted Almighty Delbanco dispels sanctimony differently reviving forgotten figure St Louis minister educator William Greenleaf Eliot — coincidentally T S Eliot’s grandfather — hated slavery tolerated fugitive slave law bitter end held hope conciliatory gradual emancipation History usually plow people equivocator worse Delbanco restores moral seriousness brutally uncertain timesOver Delbanco’s account accurate well vivid although I wish hadn’t garbled detail adoption fugitive slave clause 1787 book’s serious lapse He make strong case centrality fugitive slave sectional crisis indeed

The word “Chernobyl” ha long synonymous catastrophic reactor explosion 1986 — grim shorthand still qualifies three decade later world’s worst nuclear disasterAs infamous it’s easy forget calamity

The word “empire” ha distinct place American lexicon readily applicable country rarely ever United States itselfEven spring 2003 American force occupying Iraq Afghanistan government official writing torture memo defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld seemed almost offended reporter asked whether United States wa engaged anything like “empirebuilding” “We’re imperialistic” Rumsfeld insisted “We never I can’t imagine you’d even ask question”The tone aggrieved incredulity may laid little thick Rumsfeld’s sentiment neatly aligned many Americans prefer see country — republic wa born revolution necessarily hostile imperial ruleThis selfimage “consoling it’s also costly” Daniel Immerwahr writes “How Hide Empire” “At various time inhabitant US Empire shot shelled starved interned dispossessed

compunction wa decidedly wane Theodore Roosevelt serving William McKinley’s assistant secretary navy pursued SpanishAmerican War 1898 zeal would expect someone toted around book called “AngloSaxon

murderous combination American shelling Japanese slaughter civilian call war “by far destructive event ever take place US soil”The role racism played country’s colonial acquisition wa palpable sometimes counterintuitive While imperialist often spoke “civilizing” “savages” ardent antiimperialists 19th century white supremacist like John C Calhoun senator South Carolina wa wary letting “any Caucasian race” Union The 1867 purchase Alaska Russians encountered similar resistance The Nation complaining prospect “Exquimaux fellow citizens” As Immerwahr tartly observes “The deal went end
