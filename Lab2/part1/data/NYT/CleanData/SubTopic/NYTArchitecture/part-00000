paris — l’architecte qui supervisé la conception du système de sécurité incendie à notredame reconnu que de responsables avaient sousestimé la vitesse à laquelle un feu pouvait démarrer et se propager dans la cathédrale avec pour conséquence un incendie bien plus dévastateur qu’anticipéle système reposait sur l’hypothèse que si la cathédrale venait à prendre feu le anciennes poutres de chêne dans le combles brûleraient lentement laissant largement assez de temp pour que le flammes soient maîtrisés d’après benjamin mouton l’architecte en chef de monument historiques qui supervisa la mise en place de sécurités incendiecontrairement à ce qui existe sur certains site sensibles aux étatsunis le alarmes incendie à notredame n’étaient pa directement reliées à une caserne de pompiers il fallait d’abord qu’un agent de sécurité de la cathédrale gravisse une série d’escaliers raides pour atteindre le combles un trajet qu’une personne ‘sportive’ met six minute à effectuer explique moutonce n’est qu’après qu’un incendie était constaté que le pompiers étaient avertis et déployés autrement dit même une réaction impeccable à un incendie intégrait un délai d’environ 20 minute entre le moment où l’alarme retentissait et celui où le pompiers étaient arrivés et montés jusqu’aux combles avec de kilo de lance à incendie et de matériel pour enfin s’attaquer aux flammesce délai s’est avéré dévastateur“là où j’étais stupéfait c’est de la rapidité avec laquelle le chêne de notredame brûlé” dit mouton “un chêne aussi vieux ça ne peut pa brûler comme une allumette c’est absolument incompréhensible”certains expert en sécurité incendie affirment cependant que mouton et son équipe avaient sousestimé le risque et que la procédure de sécurité qu’ils avaient conçu était bien trop lente pour que le feu puisse être combattu à temps“ça n’a aucun sens” affirme jonathan barnett un responsable de sécurité incendie chez basic expert en australie “vingt minute avant que le gen n’interviennent c’est un délai énorme quand de la charpente lourde se met à brûler ne peut pa l’éteindre donc je n’ai aucune idée de la raison pour laquelle il ont prévu ce délai”françois chatillon un architecte en chef de monument historiques impliqué dans la restauration de nombreux monument en france signale également qu’il était bien connu que le poutres de chêne sou le toit en plomb de notredame présentaient un risque élevé d’incendieune fois le feu démarré ditil “c’est comme jeter une allumette dans une boite qui en est remplie c’est impossible à éteindre”pour lui ce qui est surprenant ce n’est pa que notredame ait brûlé cette semaine mais qu’elle “n’ait pa brûlé plus tôt”m mouton et son équipe n’étaient le seuls en charge de la sécurisation d’un monument aussi précieux que notredame au minimum leurs plan devaient être validés par leur hiérarchie au ministère de la culturecharlotte hubert présidente de la compagnie de architectes en chef de monument historiques souligne que la sécurité dans de tels bâtiments est étroitement réglementée“on ne laisse pa le clés à l’architecte en chef pour qu’il fasse exactement ce qu’il veut” expliquetelletoujours estil selon de expert en sécurité incendie que deux de principaux responsables à l’époque mouton et le lieutenantcolonel régis prunet ancien pompier et conseiller en sécurité incendie pour le ministère de la culture semblent avoir mal évalué le mesures antifeu nécessaires pour protéger un bâtiment aussi atypique complexe et irremplaçable que notredameselon de scientifiques consultés par le new york time bien qu’un bois dense puisse mettre du temp à se consumer entièrement un feu allait se propager naturellement et très rapidement parmi le vieilles poutres de notredame supposer le contraire disentil était une erreurm mouton l’architecte en chef de monument historiques supervisa une rénovation de la sécurité incendie alors qu’il était responsable de notredame entre 2000 et 2013“le sujet de la sécurité incendie été posé à partir de mon arrivée” dit mouton “j’ai géré le sujet de bout en bout”m prunet en tant que conseiller en sécurité incendie à la direction générale de patrimoines au sein du ministère de la culture travailla avec mouton et son équipeles deux hommes faisaient face à une tâche monumentale il n’y avait pa de plan approprié en place pour la protection contre le feu ni même pour évacuer le touristes et le fidèles en ca d’incendie explique prunet c’était un miracle que rien ne fût déjà arrivé ditil et selon lui une grande ironie que cela arrive si rapidement après qu’un plan soit finalement en placem mouton et prunet expliquent avoir eu main libre pour concevoir le système de protection incendie le plus efficace possible l’argent n’était pa un problèmequand le budget s’avéra plus conséquent que prévu le autorités françaises trouvèrent le financements et le délai d’installation du nouveau système de sécurité passa de deux à quatre se rappelle mouton“le projet n’a pa été réduit pour de question financières je vous le certifie absolument” ditilmême si aucun coût ne fut épargné la question de la préservation de la vieille charpente fut abordée de façon conservatrice pour la laisser dans son état d’origine le concepteurs tenaient à ce que le combles ne soient pa altérées par de mesures de protection avec de extincteurs automatiques ou de murs coupefeusi le choix avait été fait de sacrifier cette ‘pureté’ de la charpente en d’autre termes de trouver un compromis entre ce qui était possible il 850 et ce qui convient aujourd’hui la flèche aurait pu selon de expert être sauvée si de murs coupefeu ont pu être placés ailleurs dans la cathédrale il ne l’ont pa été dans le combles d’après prunet la taille et la complexité de leur structure était d’une toute autre ampleur“pour la cathédrale de paris c’était compliqué parce que vous aviez un enchaînement de poutres en chêne ce qu’on appelle la forêt” expliquetilmais mouton surtout renoncé à installer de murs coupefeu car cela risquait d’être “mutilant” pour la structure selon lui“il est vrai que ça avait été évoqué mais ça n’a pa été retenu” ditil “ça change l’apparence mais aussi le éléments car pour mettre en place une cloison il faut aussi couper le bois c’est mutilant”et selon prunet de extincteurs automatiques n’ont pa été rajoutés parce que “le problème c’est que vous noyez la structure”au lieu de cela expliquentils leur équipe avait misé sur la prévention et la détection c’était un choix délibérédeux agent de sécurité étaient sur le site pour surveiller jour et nuit la délicate charpente du toit tel le coffrefort d’une banqueun réseau de détecteurs de fumée et de chaleur était réparti de par la cathédrale trois fois par jour quelqu’un montait vérifier que le système fonctionnaitm mouton affirme qu’il avait même testé le temp qu’il fallait pour qu’un agent fasse une levée de doute en faisant la course avec l’un d’entre eux jusqu’en haut de combles“ça met un certain temp compris pour quelqu’un de très sportif” ditil “cette solution m’avait paru raisonnable en considérant que c’est du vieux chêne donc ça ne brûlait pa comme ça”par ailleurs le système d’alerte semble également avoir été défaillant en commençant par la réponse à la première alerte de 18h20 lundi dernierl’agent de sécurité ne constatant pa de feu avait donné une fin d’alerte et était redescendumais selon glenn corbett professeur associé et spécialiste de la science du feu au john jay college criminal justice à new york quand une alarme retentit il est impératif d’identifier l’origine et la cause de son déclenchement compris si c’est une défaillance ou si un insecte s’est introduit dans l’appareil“la cause de la première alarme n’a pa été assez recherchée ” dit corbett “c’est probablement leur plus grande erreur”on peut supposer qu’à ce momentlà un feu couvait vraisemblablement déjà quelque part dans le combles et commençait à se propager son origine reste à déterminercertains expert en sécurité incendie ne comprennent pa comment mouton pu croire qu’un feu se propagerait lentement sur du vieux bois durm corbett explique qu’on longtemps cru que le feux de charpente dans de bâtiments du 19ème siècle étaient forcément de ‘combustion lente’ une croyance largement remise en cause de joursm barnett l’expert australien souligne que le temp qu’il faut pour qu’un un épais morceau de charpente soit entièrement brûlé diffère entièrement de la vitesse de propagation du feu“il sousestimé le fait que c’est une très grande surface” explique barnett “il beaucoup d’énergie et ça se propage très rapidement”le temp que la deuxième alarme sonne à 18h43 et qu’un agent de sécurité remonte le escaliers le feu s’était déjà mû en brasierles pompiers n’ont été alertés qu’à 18h51“on aurait pu éviter tout cela avec un système de détection moderne” assure guillaume poitrinal président de la fondation du patrimoinela technologie de détection rapide en place à notredame était un système d’aspiration de la fumée fourni par siemens en 2013 mais l’entreprise affirme qu’elle n’avait pa signé de contrat de maintenance et qu’elle ne peut pa s’exprimer sur de potentielles question opérationnellesles alarmes à incendie en france ne préviennent jamais automatiquement le pompiers confirme un porteparole de sapeurspompiers de paris“il peut avoir de fausses alertes c’est pourquoi le pompiers demandent que quelqu’un aille vérifier” explique gabriel plus le porteparolemais pour de expert extérieurs dans le ca de notredame la procédure de sécurité incendie choisie ne prévoyait pa suffisamment de temp pour celaune autre solution aurait pu être envisagée la présence permanente de pompiers sur le sitec’est le ca dans certains bâtiments encourant “un risque significatif” lors d’un incendie explique plus comme par exemple le louvre le palais de justice l’assemblée nationale et la bibliothèque nationalenotredame ditil n’en faisait pa partiem mouton reconnaît qu’une veille de pompiers sur le site aurait été la seule façon fiable d’éviter tout dégât par le feu mais que cela ne pouvait se justifier “alors qu’il de incendies qui s’allument partout à paris et en banlieue”il fallait accepter une part de risque ditil “ça fait partie de la relativité de choses”“je suis très embarrassé par ce qui arrive” confie moutonavec le recul auraitil conçu le système de façon différente aujourd’hui“la détection serait restée la même” ditil “mais c’est la gestion qui change”“bien sûr c’est le premières minute qui comptent” ditil avant de marquer une pause “a posteriori toujours tort et aurait sûrement fait mieux “
